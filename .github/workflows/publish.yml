# Release workflow
#
# We parallelize builds, dump all the artifacts into a release, and then publish the release
# This guarantees everything is properly built and cached in case anything goes wrong
#
# The artifacts also need to get pushed to the various places
# - the CLI goes to the releases page for binstall
# - the extension goes to the marketplace
# - the docs go to the website
#
# We need to be aware of the channel we're releasing
# - prerelease is master
# - stable is whatever the latest stable release is (ie 0.4 or 0.5 or 0.6 etc)
#
# It's intended that this workflow is run manually, and only when we're ready to release
