# Promote the current main branch to a stable release.
# This will not actually release anything, so you need to run the release workflow after this.
#
# IE if the current master version is 0.4.0-rc.7, this will create a PR to promote it to 0.4.0
#
# - update the version in the Cargo.toml to v0.4.0
# - generate a v0.4 branch
# - push the branch to the repository
# - then bump 0.4.0-rc.1 to 0.5.0-rc.0
#
# This means main will never be a "stable" release, and we can always merge breaking changes to main
# and backport them to the latest stable release
#
# This is configured to be ran manually, but could honestly just be a release workflow
