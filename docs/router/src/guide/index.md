# Dioxus Router: Guide
In this guide you'll learn how to effectively use Dioxus Router whether you're building a small todo app or the next FAANG company. We will create a small website with a blog, homepage, and an admin page. 

#### You'll learn how to
- Create routes and render "pages".
- Utilize nested routes, create a navigation bar, and render content for a set of routes.
- Gather URL parameters to dynamically display content.
- Redirect to other pages in your site.

> This site will only display the features of Dioxus Router. It will not include any actual blog or admin functionality. To keep things simple we will only be using a single file, this is not the recommended way of doing things with a real application.
