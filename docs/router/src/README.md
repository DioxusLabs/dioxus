# Dioxus Router: Introduction
Whether or not you're building a website, desktop app, or mobile app, organizing your app's views into "pages" can be an effective method for organization and maintainability. 

Dioxus comes with a router built-in. To start utilizing Dioxus Router, enable the ``router`` feature in your ``Cargo.toml`` file.
```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus = { version = "x.x.x", features = [.., "router"] }
```

In this book you'll find a short [guide](./guide/index.md) to get up to speed with Dioxus Router, as well as the router's [reference](./reference/index.md).
