# Dioxus Router: Introduction
Whether or not you're building a website, desktop app, or mobile app, organizing
your app's views into "pages" can be an effective method for organization and
maintainability.

Dioxus comes with a router built-in. To start utilizing Dioxus Router, enable
the `router` feature in your `Cargo.toml` file.
```toml
[dependencies]
dioxus = { version = "x.x.x", features = [.., "router"] }
```

In this book you'll find a short [guide](./guide/index.md) to get up to speed
with Dioxus Router. For the API reference see [here][ref].
