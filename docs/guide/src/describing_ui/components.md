# Components

Just like you wouldn't want to write a complex program in a single, long, `main` function, you shouldn't build a complex UI in a single `App` function. Instead, it would be better to break down the functionality of an app in logical parts called components.

A component is a rust function that may or may not take some input, called props, and returns an `Element` describing the UI it wants to render. In fact, our `App` function is a component!

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/hello_world_desktop.rs:component}}
```

A Component is responsible for some rendering task â€“ typically, rendering an isolated part of the user interface. For example, you could have an `About` component that renders a short description of Dioxus Labs:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/components.rs:About}}
```

Then, you can render your component in another component, similarly to how elements are rendered:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/components.rs:App}}
```

> At this point, it might seem like components are nothing more than functions. However, as you learn more about the features of Dioxus, you'll see that they are actually more powerful!
