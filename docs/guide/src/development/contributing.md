# Contributing

Development happens in the [Dioxus GitHub repository](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus). If you've found a bug or have an idea for a feature, please submit an issue (check if someone hasn't [done it already](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues) though).

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/discussions) can be used as a place to ask for help or talk about features. You can also join [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM) where some development discussion happens.

## Improving Docs

If you'd like to improve the docs, PRs are welcome! Both Rust docs ([source](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages)) and this guide ([source](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/docs/guide)) can be found in the GitHub repo.

## Working on the Ecosystem

Part of what makes React great is the rich ecosystem. We'd like the same for Dioxus! So if you have a library in mind that you'd like to write, and that you think many people would benefit from, it will be appreciated. You can [browse npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:react-component) for inspiration.

## Bugs & Features

If you've fixed [an issue that's open](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues), feel free to submit a PR! You can also take a look at [the roadmap](./roadmap.md) and work on something in there. Consider [reaching out](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM) to the team first to make sure everyone's on the same page, and you don't do useless work!

All pull requests (including those made by a team member) must be approved by at least one other team member.
Larger, more nuanced decisions about design, architecture, breaking changes, trade-offs, etc. are made by team consensus.
