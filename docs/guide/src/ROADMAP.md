# Roadmap & Feature-set

Before we dive into Dioxus, feel free to take a look at our feature set and roadmap to see if what Dioxus can do today works for you.

If a feature that you need doesn't exist or you want to contribute to projects on the roadmap, feel free to get involved by [joining the discord](https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM).

Generally, here's the status of each platform:

- **Web**: Dioxus is a great choice for pure web-apps - especially for CRUD/complex apps. However, it does lack the ecosystem of React, so you might be missing a component library or some useful hook.

- **SSR**: Dioxus is a great choice for pre-rendering, hydration, and rendering HTML on a web endpoint. Be warned - the VirtualDom is not (currently) `Send + Sync`.

- **Desktop**: You can build very competent single-window desktop apps right now. However, multi-window apps require support from Dioxus core and are not ready.

- **Mobile**: Mobile support is very young. You'll be figuring things out as you go and there are not many support crates for peripherals.

- **LiveView**: LiveView support is very young. You'll be figuring things out as you go. Thankfully, none of it is too hard and any work can be upstreamed into Dioxus.
