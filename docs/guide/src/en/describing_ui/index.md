# Describing the UI

Dioxus is a *declarative* framework. This means that instead of telling Dioxus what to do (e.g. to "create an element" or "set color to red") we simply *declare* what we want the UI to look like using RSX.

You have already seen a simple example or RSX syntax in the "hello world" application:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/hello_world_desktop.rs:component}}
```

Here, we use the `rsx!` macro to *declare* that we want a `div` element, containing the text `"Hello, world!"`. Dioxus takes the RSX and constructs a UI from it.

## RSX Features

RSX is very similar to HTML in that it describes elements with attributes and children. Here's an empty `div` element in RSX, as well as the resulting HTML:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:empty}}
```
```html
<div></div>
```

### Children

To add children to an element, put them inside the `{}` brackets. They can be either other elements, or text. For example, you could have an `ol` (ordered list) element, containing 3 `li` (list item) elements, each of which contains some text: 

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:children}}
```
```html
<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
```

### Fragments

You can also "group" elements by wrapping them in `Fragment {}`. This will not create any additional elements.

> Note: you can also render multiple elements at the top level of `rsx!` and they will be automatically grouped â€“ no need for an explicit `Fragment {}` there.

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:fragments}}
```

```html
<p>First Item</p>
<p>Second Item</p>
<span>a group</span>
<span>of three</span>
<span>items</span>
```

### Attributes

Attributes are also specified inside the `{}` brackets, using the `name: value` syntax. You can provide the value as a literal in the RSX:
```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:attributes}}
```
```html
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="primary_button" autofocus="true">Log In</a>
```

> Note: All attributes defined in `dioxus-html` follow the snake_case naming convention. They transform their `snake_case` names to HTML's `camelCase` attributes.

#### Custom Attributes

Dioxus has a pre-configured set of attributes that you can use. RSX is validated at compile time to make sure you didn't specify an invalid attribute. If you want to override this behavior with a custom attribute name, specify the attribute in quotes:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:custom_attributes}}
```
```html
<b customAttribute="value">
    Rust is cool
</b>
```

### Interpolation

Similarly to how you can [format](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/fmt.html) Rust strings, you can also interpolate in RSX text. Use `{variable}` to Display the value of a variable in a string, or `{variable:?}` to use the Debug representation:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:formatting}}
```
```html

<div class="country-es">Coordinates: (42, 0)
    <div>ES</div>
    <div>42</div>
</div>
```

### Expressions

You can include arbitrary Rust expressions within RSX, but you must escape them in `[]` brackets:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/rsx_overview.rs:expression}}
```
```html
<span>DIOXUS</span>
```
