# Component Props

Just like you can pass arguments to a function, you can pass props to a component that customize its behavior! The components we've seen so far didn't accept any props – so let's write some components that do.

## `#[derive(Props)]`

Component props are a single struct annotated with `#[derive(Props)]`. For a component to accept props, the type of its argument must be `Scope<YourPropsStruct>`. Then, you can access the value of the props using `cx.props`.

There are 2 flavors of Props structs:
- Owned props:
  - Don't have an associated lifetime
  - Implement `PartialEq`, allowing for memoization (if the props don't change, Dioxus won't re-render the component)
- Borrowed props:
  - [Borrow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/scope/borrow.html) from a parent component
  - Cannot be memoized due to lifetime constraints


### Owned Props

Owned Props are very simple – they don't borrow anything. Example:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_owned_props.rs:Likes}}
```

You can then pass prop values to the component the same way you would pass attributes to an element:
```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_owned_props.rs:App}}
```

### Borrowed Props

Owning props works well if your props are easy to copy around – like a single number. But what if we need to pass a larger data type, like a String from an `App` Component to a `TitleCard` subcomponent? A naive solution might be to [`.clone()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) the String, creating a copy of it for the subcomponent – but this would be inefficient, especially for larger Strings.

Rust allows for something more efficient – borrowing the String as a `&str` – this is what Borrowed Props are for!

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_borrowed_props.rs:TitleCard}}
```

We can then use the component like this:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_borrowed_props.rs:App}}
```

## Prop Options

The `#[derive(Props)]` macro has some features that let you customize the behavior of props.

### Optional Props

You can create optional fields by using the `Option<…>` type for a field:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:OptionalProps}}
```

Then, you can choose to either provide them or not:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:OptionalProps_usage}}
```

### Explicitly Required `Option`s

If you want to explicitly require an `Option`, and not an optional prop, you can annotate it with `#[props(!optional)]`:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:ExplicitOption}}
```

Then, you have to explicitly pass either `Some("str")` or `None`:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:ExplicitOption_usage}}
```

### Default Props

You can use `#[props(default = 42)]` to make a field optional and specify its default value:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:DefaultComponent}}
```

Then, similarly to optional props, you don't have to provide it:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:DefaultComponent_usage}}
```

### Automatic Conversion with `.into`

It is common for Rust functions to accept `impl Into<SomeType>` rather than just `SomeType` to support a wider range of parameters. If you want similar functionality with props, you can use `#[props(into)]`. For example, you could add it on a `String` prop – and `&str` will also be automatically accepted, as it can be converted into `String`:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:IntoComponent}}
```

Then, you can use it so:

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/component_props_options.rs:IntoComponent_usage}}
```

## The `inline_props` macro

So far, every Component function we've seen had a corresponding ComponentProps struct to pass in props. This was quite verbose... Wouldn't it be nice to have props as simple function arguments? Then we wouldn't need to define a Props struct, and instead of typing `cx.props.whatever`, we could just use `whatever` directly!

`inline_props` allows you to do just that. Instead of typing the "full" version:

```rust
#[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
struct TitleCardProps {
    title: String,
}

fn TitleCard(cx: Scope<TitleCardProps>) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        h1 { "{cx.props.title}" }
    })
}
```

...you can define a function that accepts props as arguments. Then, just annotate it with `#[inline_props]`, and the macro will turn it into a regular Component for you:

```rust
#[inline_props]
fn TitleCard(cx: Scope, title: String) -> Element {
    cx.render(rsx!{
        h1 { "{title}" }
    })
}
```

> While the new Component is shorter and easier to read, this macro should not be used by library authors since you have less control over Prop documentation.
