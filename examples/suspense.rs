//! Suspense in Dioxus
//!
//! Currently, `rsx!` does not accept futures as values. To achieve the functionality
//! of suspense, we need to make a new component that performs its own suspense
//! handling.
//!
//! In this example, we render the `Doggo` component which starts a future that
//! will cause it to fetch a random dog image from the Dog API. Since the data
//! is not ready immediately, we render some loading text.
//!
//! We can achieve the majoirty of suspense functionality by composing "suspenseful"
//! primitives in our own custom components.
