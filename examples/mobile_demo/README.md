# Dioxus Mobile demo

## How this project was generated

Right now, Dioxus supports mobile targets including iOS and Android. However, our tooling is not mature enough to include the build commands directly.

This project was generated using [cargo-mobile2](https://github.com/tauri-apps/cargo-mobile2). We have yet to integrate this generation into the Dioxus-CLI. The open issue for this is [#1157](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/issues/1157).

## Running this project

Because the tooling and ecosystem is still young, Dioxus mobile can be difficult to setup and run. We have [detailed guides](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.5/getting_started) for creating, building, and running on both iOS and Android.
