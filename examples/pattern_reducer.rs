//! Example: Reducer Pattern
//! -----------------
//!
//! This example shows how to encapsulate state in dioxus components with the reducer pattern.
//! This pattern is very useful when a single component can handle many types of input that can
//! be represented by an enum.
//!
//! Currently we don't have a reducer pattern hook. If you'd like to add it,
//! feel free to make a PR.

use dioxus::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    dioxus::desktop::launch(app);
}

fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
    let state = use_state(&cx, PlayerState::new);

    cx.render(rsx!(
        div {
            h1 {"Select an option"}
            h3 { "The radio is... " [state.is_playing()] "!" }
            button { onclick: move |_| state.make_mut().reduce(PlayerAction::Pause),
                "Pause"
            }
            button { onclick: move |_| state.make_mut().reduce(PlayerAction::Play),
                "Play"
            }
        }
    ))
}

enum PlayerAction {
    Pause,
    Play,
}

    is_playing: bool,

impl PlayerState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { is_playing: false }

    fn reduce(&mut self, action: PlayerAction) {
        match action {
            PlayerAction::Pause => self.is_playing = false,
            PlayerAction::Play => self.is_playing = true,
        }

            true => "currently playing!",
