//! This example is a simple showcase of Dioxus Server Functions.
//!
//! The other examples in this folder showcase advanced features of server functions like custom
//! data types, error handling, websockets, and more.
//!
//! This example is meant to just be a simple starting point to show how server functions work.
//!
//! ## Server Functions
//!
//! In Dioxus, Server Functions are `axum` backend endpoints that can be called directly from the client
//! as if you were simply calling a local Rust function. You can do anything with a server function
//! that an Axum handler can do like extracting path, query, headers, and body parameters.
//!
//! ## Server Function Arguments
//!
//! Unlike Axum handlers, the arguments of the server functions have some special magic enabled by
//! the accompanying `#[get]`/`#[post]` attributes. This magic enables you to choose between
//! arguments that are purely serializable (i.e. `String`, `i32`, `Vec<T>`, etc) as the JSON body of
//!
//! the request *or* arguments that implement Axum's `FromRequest` trait. This magic enables simple
//! RPC functions but also complex extractors for things like auth, sessions, cookies, and more.
//!
//! ## Server Function Return Types
//!
//! The return type of the server function is also somewhat magical. Unlike Axum handlers, all server
//! functions must return a `Result` type, giving the client an opportunity to handle errors properly.
//!
//! The `Ok` type can be anything that implements `Serialize + DeserializeOwned` so it can be sent
//! to the client as JSON, or it can be anything that implements `IntoResponse` just like an Axum handler.
//!
//! ## Error Types
//!
//! The `Err` type of the server function return type is also somewhat special. The `Err` type can be:
//! - `anyhow::Error` (the `dioxus_core::Err` type alias) for untyped errors with rich context. Note
//!    that these errors will always downcast to `ServerFnError` on the client, losing the original
//!    error stack and type.
//! - `ServerFnError` for typed errors with a status code and optional message.
//! - `StatusCode` for returning raw HTTP status codes.
//! - `HttpError` for returning HTTP status codes with custom messages.
//! - Any custom errors that implement `From<ServerFnError>` and are `Serialize`/`Deserialize`
//!
//! The only way to set the HTTP status code of the response is to use one of the above error types,
//! or to implement a custom `IntoResponse` type that sets the status code manually.
//!
//! The `anyhow::Error` type is the best choice for rapid development, but is somewhat limited when
//! handling specific error cases on the client since all errors are downcast to `ServerFnError`.
//!
//! ## Calling Server Functions from the Client
//!
//! Server functions can be called from the client by simply importing the function and calling it
//! like a normal Rust function. Unlike regular axum handlers, Dioxus server functions have a few
//! non-obvious restrictions.
//!
//! Most importantly, the arguments to the server function must implement either `Deserialize` *or*
//! `IntoRequest`. The `IntoRequest` trait is a Dioxus abstraction that represents the "inverse" of the
//! Axum `FromRequest` trait. Anything that is sent to the server from the client must be both extractable
//! with `FromRequest` on the server *and* constructible with `IntoRequest` on the client.
//!
//! Types like `WebsocketOptions` implement `IntoRequest` and pass along things like upgrade headers
//! to the server so that the server can properly upgrade the connection.
//!
//! When receiving data from the server, the return type must implement `Deserialize` *or* `FromResponse`.
//! The `FromResponse` trait is the inverse of Axum's `IntoResponse` trait, and is implemented
//! for types like `Websocket` where the raw HTTP response is needed to complete the construction
//! of the type.
//!
//! ## Server-only Extractors
//!
//! Because the arguments of the server function define the structure of the public API, some extractors
//! might not make sense to expose directly, nor would they be possible to construct on the client.
//! For example, on the web, you typically don't work directly with cookies since the browser handles
//! them for you. In these cases, the client would omit the `Cookie` header entirely, and we would need
//! "hoist" our extractor into a "server-only extractor".
//!
//! Server-only extractors are function arguments placed after the path in the `#[get]`/`#[post]` attribute.
//! These arguments are extracted on the server, but not passed in from the client. This lets the
//! server function remain callable from the client, while still allowing full access to axum's
//! extractors.
//!
//! ```
//! #[post("/api/authenticate", auth: AuthCookie)]
//! async fn authenticate() -> Result<User> { /* ... */ }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Automatic Registration
//!
//! Unlike axum handlers, server functions do not need to be manually registered with a router.
//! By default, *all* server functions in your app will be automatically registered with the
//! server when you call `dioxus::launch` or create a router manually with `dioxus::server::router()`.
//!
//! However, not all server functions are automatically registered by default. Server functions that
//! take a `State<T>` extractor cannot be automatically added to the router since the dioxus router
//! type does not know how to construct the `T` type.
//!
//! These server functions will be registered once the `ServerFnState<T>` layer is added to the app with
//! `router = router.layer(ServerFnState::new(your_state))`.
//!
//! ## Middleware
//!
//! Middleware can be added to server functions using the `#[middleware(MiddlewareType)]` attribute.
//! Middleware will be applied in the order they are specified, and will be applied before any
//! server-only extractors.
//!
//! To add router-level middleware, you can customize the axum `Router` using layers and extensions
//! as you would in a normal axum app.
//!
//! ## Anonymous Server Functions
//!
//! The `#[server]` attribute can be used without a path to create an anonymous server function.
//! These functions are still exposed as HTTP endpoints, but their names are procedurally generated
//! from the module path, function name, and a hash of the function signature. This makes it hard to
//! call these functions with `curl` or `postman`, but save you the trouble of coming up with unique
//! names for simple functions that are only called from your Dioxus app.
//!
//! If you're shipping desktop/mobile apps, we don't recommend using anonymous server functions
//! since the function names could change between builds and thus make older versions of your app
//! incompatible with newer versions of your server.
//!
//! ## Cross-platform Clients
//!
//! Server functions can be called from any platform (web, desktop mobile, etc) and use the best
//! underlying `fetch` implementation available.
//!
//! ## More examples
//!
//! With Dioxus Fullstack 0.7, pretty much anything you can do with an Axum handler, you can do with
//! a server function. More advanced examples can be found in this folder showcasing custom data types,
//! error handling, websockets, and more.
