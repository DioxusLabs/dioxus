//! This example demonstrates server-sent events (SSE) using Dioxus Fullstack.
//!
//! Server-sent events allow the server to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection.
//! This is useful for real-time updates, notifications, or any scenario where the server needs to
//! send data to the client without the client explicitly requesting it.
//!
//! SSE is a simpler alternative to WebSockets, not requiring a full-duplex, stateful connection with
//! the server. Instead, it uses a single long-lived HTTP connection to stream events from the server to the client.
//!
//! This means that SSE messages are stringly encoded, and thus binary data must be base64 encoded.
//! If you need to send binary data, consider using the `Streaming<T>` type instead, which lets
//! you send raw bytes over a streaming HTTP response with a custom encoding. You'd reach for SSE
//! when dealing with clients that might not support custom streaming protocols.
//!
//! Calling an SSE endpoint is as simple as calling any other server function. The return type of an
//! SSE endpoint is a `ServerEvents<T>` where `T` is the type of event you want to send to the client.
//!
//! On the client, the `ServerEvents<T>` type implements `Stream<Item = Result<T, ServerFnError>>`
//! so you can use it with async streams to get new events as they arrive.
//!
//! `T` must be serializable and deserializable, so anything that implements `Serialize` and `Deserialize`
//! can be used as an event type. Calls to `.recv()` will wait for the next event to arrive and
//! deserialize it into the correct type.
