# Dioxus PWA example

This is a basic example of a progressive web app (PWA) using Dioxus and Dioxus CLI.
Currently PWA functionality requires the use of a service worker and manifest file, so this isn't 100% Rust yet.

It is also very much usable as a template for your projects, if you're aiming to create a PWA.

## Try the example

Make sure you have Dioxus CLI installed (if you're unsure, run `cargo install dioxus-cli`).

You can run `dioxus serve` in this directory to start the web server locally, or run
`dioxus build --release` to build the project so you can deploy it on a separate web-server.

## Resources

If you're just getting started with PWAs, here are some useful resources:

* [PWABuilder docs](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/)
* [MDN article on PWAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)

For service worker scripting (in JavaScript):

* [Service worker guide from PWABuilder](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/sw-intro)
* [Service worker examples, also from PWABuilder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-serviceworkers)

If you want to stay as close to 100% Rust as possible, you can try using [wasi-worker](https://github.com/dunnock/wasi-worker) to replace the JS service worker file. The JSON manifest will still be required though.
