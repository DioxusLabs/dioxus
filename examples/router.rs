//! An advanced usage of the router with nested routes and redirects.
//!
//! Dioxus implements an enum-based router, which allows you to define your routes in a type-safe way.
//! However, since we need to bake quite a bit of logic into the enum, we have to add some extra syntax.
//!
//! Note that you don't need to use advanced features like nest, redirect, etc, since these can all be implemented
//! manually, but they are provided as a convenience.
