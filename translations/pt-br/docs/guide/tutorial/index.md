# Putting it all together

So far, we've covered the basics of Dioxus. We've talked about:

- Elements
- Components
- Interactivity
- State Management
- Async Actions
- Styling

In this chapter, we'll build a real-world weather app that combines everything we've learned into a cute application that you can run locally. It'll let us monitor different locations simultaneously and periodically check for updates.

The app is running on the web [here]() but is also available:

- as a desktop app
- a mobile app
- and as an API endpoint here

Let's get started! Head on to the next chapter where we create our app.
