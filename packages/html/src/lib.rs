//! # Dioxus Namespace for HTML
//!
//! This crate provides a set of compile-time correct HTML elements that can be used with the Rsx and Html macros.
//! This system allows users to easily build new tags, new types, and customize the output of the Rsx and Html macros.
//!
//! An added benefit of this approach is the ability to lend comprehensive documentation on how to use these elements inside
//! of the Rsx and Html macros. Each element comes with a substantial amount of documentation on how to best use it, hopefully
//! making the development cycle quick.
//!
//! All elements are used as zero-sized unit structs with trait impls.
//!
//! Currently, we don't validate for structures, but do validate attributes.
