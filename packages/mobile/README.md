## Overview

`dioxus-mobile` is a re-export of `dioxus-desktop` with some minor tweaks and documentation changes. As this crate evolves, it will provide some more unique features to mobile, but for now, it's very similar to the desktop crate.

Dioxus Mobile supports both iOS and Android. However, Android support is still quite experimental and requires a lot of configuration. A good area to contribute here would be to improve the CLI tool to include bundling and mobile configuration.

## Getting Set up

Getting set up with mobile can but quite challenging. The tooling here isn't great (yet) and might take some hacking around to get things working. macOS M1 is broadly unexplored and might not work for you.

You can read [our guide](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.5/getting_started) on mobile development with Dioxus to get started.
