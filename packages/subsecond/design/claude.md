## Prompt:
what is a relocation in a binary

## Response:
A relocation in binary code refers to the process of adjusting memory addresses or references within a program when its code or data is moved to a different memory location. Let me explain this concept step by step:

1.  During program compilation and linking:
    *   Initially, the compiler generates code with placeholder addresses for variables, functions, and other symbols
    *   These placeholders need to be updated (or "relocated") to their actual memory addresses when the program is loaded
2.  Why relocations are needed:
    *   Programs often can't know their final memory location at compile time
    *   The operating system may load the program at different addresses each time
    *   Shared libraries need to work regardless of where they're loaded in memory
3.  Example: Let's say you have an instruction to jump to a function:

    ```
    JUMP 0x1000  // Jump to address 0x1000
    ```

    If the entire program gets loaded 0x500 bytes later in memory, this needs to be relocated to:

    ```
    JUMP 0x1500  // Original address + offset
    ```

4.  Types of relocations:
    *   Absolute relocations: The entire address is updated
    *   Relative relocations: Only the offset from the current position is adjusted
    *   GOT/PLT relocations: Special relocations for dynamic linking
5.  In modern systems:
    *   Position Independent Code (PIC) is often used to minimize required relocations
    *   This allows code to run correctly regardless of its absolute memory location
    *   Still, some relocations are usually necessary, especially for global data

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects of binary relocations?

## Prompt:
can a relocation point to a symbol/section outside a given `.o` file?

## Response:
Yes, absolutely! This is actually one of the main purposes of relocations - to reference symbols and sections that are external to the current object file. These are typically called "external relocations" and they're essential for linking multiple object files together.

Here are the common cases:

1.  Referencing functions defined in other `.o` files
2.  Accessing global variables declared in other compilation units
3.  Referencing sections (like `.data`, `.text`, etc.) from other object files
4.  Pointing to symbols in shared libraries that will be resolved at runtime

For example, if you have:

```c
// file1.c
extern int global_var;  // Declared but not defined here
void foo() {
    global_var = 42;    // Will need a relocation to point to the real global_var
}

// file2.c
int global_var = 0;     // Actual definition
```

When `file1.c` is compiled into `file1.o`, the reference to `global_var` will generate a relocation entry that basically says "I need the address of symbol `global_var`, but I don't know where it is yet". The linker will later resolve this by finding `global_var`'s definition in `file2.o` and updating the relocation accordingly.

## Prompt:
what is the r\_type of a relocation?

## Response:
The r\_type (relocation type) specifies how the relocation should be performed - it defines the exact calculation/operation that should be used to modify the code/data at the relocation site.

The specific types vary by architecture. For example, on x86\_64:

*   R\_X86\_64\_64: Direct 64-bit absolute reference
*   R\_X86\_64\_PC32: 32-bit PC-relative reference
*   R\_X86\_64\_PLT32: Reference to symbol's PLT entry
*   R\_X86\_64\_GOTPCREL: Reference to symbol's GOT entry with PC-relative offset
*   R\_X86\_64\_COPY: Copy symbol at runtime
*   R\_X86\_64\_GLOB\_DAT: Create GOT entry
*   R\_X86\_64\_JUMP\_SLOT: Create PLT entry

Each type defines:

1.  The size of the field being relocated (e.g., 32 or 64 bits)
2.  How to calculate the value (e.g., absolute vs PC-relative)
3.  Any special handling needed (like GOT/PLT entries)

The linker uses this type information to know exactly how to patch the binary when resolving the relocation.

## Prompt:
what is an r\_type of 0 mean for mach-o?

## Response:
In Mach-O format, a relocation type (r\_type) of 0 typically means X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED, which indicates a direct, absolute reference that needs to be relocated. This is used for absolute addressing where the full 64-bit value needs to be rewritten.

Example use cases include:

*   Pointers to data in the \_\_data section
*   Absolute addresses that need to be filled in
*   Global variable references that require absolute addressing

This is similar to R\_X86\_64\_64 in ELF format - it's for straight absolute 64-bit pointer relocations without any fancy calculations or PC-relative adjustments.

## Prompt:
what is an r\_type of 1 mean for mach-o?

## Response:
In Mach-O format, an r\_type of 1 means X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED, which represents a 32-bit signed pc-relative reference to a symbol. This is typically used for relative addressing where the target is within ±2GB of the instruction pointer.

Key points about X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED:

*   It's used for PC-relative memory references
*   The offset is relative to the current instruction pointer (RIP)
*   The value stored is 32-bit signed
*   Common in function calls and relative jumps where the target is within reach

This is similar to R\_X86\_64\_PC32 in ELF format - it's for PC-relative addressing where you need to calculate the offset from the current instruction to the target.

## Prompt:
r\_type of 2?

## Response:
In Mach-O format, an r\_type of 2 means X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH, which is specifically for branch instructions - like conditional or unconditional jumps - that use PC-relative addressing.

The key characteristics are:

*   Used for branch instructions (jmp, jcc, etc.)
*   32-bit signed pc-relative offset
*   Similar to X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED (type 1) but specifically for branch targets
*   The linker will validate that the target is actually reachable within the branch instruction's limitations

The main difference between this and type 1 (SIGNED) is that this is specifically marked for branch instructions, which can help the linker perform specific validations and optimizations for branches.

## Prompt:
can you elaborate more on r\_type = 1? where would it be used and why

## Response:
X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED (r\_type=1) is used for PC-relative memory references, typically in data access patterns. Here are the key use cases:

1.  Accessing data in the data sections relative to the instruction pointer:

```nasm
lea rax, [rip + _some_data]  // Load effective address of data relative to RIP
mov rax, [rip + _some_global] // Load value from memory relative to RIP
```

The reason for using PC-relative addressing (RIP-relative) here is:

*   Position Independent Code (PIC) support - the code can run at any address since all references are relative
*   More efficient than absolute addressing in many cases since it only needs 32 bits for the offset
*   Common in modern x86\_64 code, especially for accessing global variables and static data

This differs from X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH (r\_type=2) which is specifically for branch instructions, and from X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED (r\_type=0) which is for absolute references.

The r\_type=1 relocation is crucial for maintaining position independence while still efficiently accessing data within ±2GB of the instruction pointer.

## Prompt:
what is the addend for a relocation? i'm parsing some relocations and only see 0 but still curious

## Response:
The addend in a relocation is an extra value that gets added to the final calculated address during relocation resolution. It's basically an additional offset that gets factored into the final address calculation.

However, there are two main ways relocations store addends:

1.  Explicit addends (like in ELF):
    *   The addend is stored directly in the relocation entry
    *   The final calculation is typically: final\_address = symbol\_value + addend
2.  Implicit addends (like in Mach-O):
    *   The addend is stored in the location being relocated
    *   The linker reads the existing content at the relocation site as the addend
    *   This is why you're seeing 0 in the relocation entries themselves

In Mach-O, when you see 0 for the addend, it doesn't necessarily mean there's no offset - the offset might be encoded in the instruction or data at the relocation site itself. The linker will read that value and use it as part of the relocation calculation.

For example, if you have:

```nasm
lea rax, [rip + offset + _some_symbol]
```

The "offset" part would be stored at the relocation site, not in the relocation entry itself.

## Prompt:
what does it mean to make a symbol undefined?

## Response:
Making a symbol undefined means marking it as a symbol that is referenced in the current object file but whose definition exists elsewhere - either in another object file, shared library, or somewhere else that will be resolved during linking.

Common cases where symbols are undefined:

1.  External function calls:

```c
// The declaration makes 'printf' an undefined symbol
extern void printf(const char* fmt, ...);
```

2.  Global variables declared but not defined:

```c
// Creates an undefined reference to 'global_var'
extern int global_var;
```

3.  Functions declared but implemented in another file:

```c
// foo.h
void foo();  // Just a declaration, foo is undefined

// foo.c
void foo() { } // Actual definition
```

When you mark a symbol as undefined, you're essentially telling the linker "I need this symbol, but you'll need to find its actual definition somewhere else during linking." The linker will then search through other object files and libraries to resolve these undefined references.

If the linker can't find a definition for an undefined symbol, you'll get the familiar "undefined reference" linker error.

## Prompt:
when I pass -undefined dynamic\_lookup, what is happening?

does the linker note the undefined symbols and then defines them by hoisting them to an import?

## Response:
Yes, when you use `-undefined dynamic_lookup`, the linker allows undefined symbols to remain unresolved during link time and defers their resolution to runtime. It essentially:

1.  Notes which symbols are undefined
2.  Instead of failing with "undefined symbol" errors, it creates special entries in the dynamic symbol table marking these symbols for dynamic lookup
3.  These symbols get added to the binary's list of imports that need to be resolved by the dynamic linker at runtime

This flag is particularly useful for:

*   Dynamic languages/runtimes where symbols might be provided at runtime
*   Plugin architectures where symbols are resolved when the plugin loads
*   Cases where you know the symbol will exist at runtime but isn't available during linking

For example, in Python extensions or other dynamic modules, you might reference symbols that will be provided by the host process when the module is loaded, but aren't available during compile/link time.

The key difference from normal linking is that instead of requiring all symbols to be resolved at link time, it allows undefined symbols to exist and sets up the infrastructure for them to be resolved later at runtime.

## Prompt:
what does it mean to "relax" a relocation?

## Response:
In binary code optimization, "relaxing" a relocation means converting a relocation that uses a larger or more complex instruction sequence into a simpler or shorter one when possible. This typically happens when the linker determines that a shorter instruction sequence can be used because the target ends up being closer than initially assumed.

Common examples:

1.  Converting a long jump to a short jump when the target is close enough
2.  Replacing an indirect jump through a PLT with a direct jump if the symbol ends up being in the same module
3.  Converting a far call (using an absolute address) to a near call (PC-relative) if within range

The key benefit is code size reduction and potentially better performance since:

*   Shorter instructions take less space
*   Direct jumps are typically faster than indirect ones
*   Fewer instructions means better cache utilization

The linker performs this optimization during the linking phase when it has enough information about final symbol locations to determine if relaxation is possible.

## Prompt:
wait is the linker actually rewriting the instructions? how? is it disassembling or simply masking/truncating the larger instruction?

## Response:
No, the linker isn't doing full disassembly! It usually relies on fixed patterns - it knows the exact byte sequences of common instruction patterns and can update them accordingly.

For example, in x86\_64:

*   A long jump might be: `E9 XX XX XX XX` (5 bytes)
*   A short jump would be: `EB XX` (2 bytes)

The linker knows these patterns and can do direct byte manipulations without needing to fully understand/disassemble the instruction stream. It's more like pattern matching and byte manipulation than true instruction rewriting.

This is also why certain instruction sequences must be used in compilers if you want the linker to be able to relax them - the linker is looking for specific byte patterns it knows how to handle. If you use a different instruction sequence that technically does the same thing but has different bytes, the linker won't recognize it as something it can relax.

Would you like to see more examples of specific byte patterns that linkers commonly know how to relax?

## Prompt:
well actually I'm trying to "diff" two object files but need to account for the relocations since two functions might be mostly the same from their assembly but functions they call end up at new addresses

how would you go about "normalizing" the assembly such that these can be compared?

## Response:
Ah interesting problem! For meaningfully comparing two object files while accounting for relocations, you'd want to "normalize" the code to account for different symbol addresses. Here's how I'd approach it:

1.  For each section with relocations:
    *   Track the location of each relocation
    *   When comparing bytes, any location that has a relocation should be treated as "equal" if they're the same relocation type
    *   Essentially mask out/ignore the actual values at relocation sites since those will naturally differ

Example pseudocode approach:

```python
def normalize_and_compare(file1, file2):
    # Get relocation sites for each file
    relocs1 = get_relocation_sites(file1)
    relocs2 = get_relocation_sites(file2)

    # Get the code sections
    code1 = get_code_section(file1)
    code2 = get_code_section(file2)

    differences = []
    for i in range(min(len(code1), len(code2))):
        # If this location has a relocation in either file
        if i in relocs1 or i in relocs2:
            # Check if both have same relocation type
            if get_reloc_type(relocs1[i]) != get_reloc_type(relocs2[i]):
                differences.append(f"Different relocation types at offset {i}")
            # Skip comparing the actual bytes
            continue

        # Compare non-relocation bytes normally
        if code1[i] != code2[i]:
            differences.append(f"Byte difference at offset {i}")
```

This way you're effectively comparing the "structure" of the code while ignoring the specific values that would change due to symbol placement.

Would this approach help with what you're trying to do? I can elaborate on handling specific types of relocations if needed.

## Prompt:
that's helpful and basically what I figured. I just have to make sure the relocations target the same symbol too right?

## Response:
Yes exactly! Just matching relocation types isn't enough - you need to check that they're targeting the same symbols too, since two instructions could both be calling functions (same r\_type) but actually calling different functions.

So in addition to matching r\_type, you'd want to compare:

1.  The symbol being referenced (the symbol index/name the relocation points to)
2.  The relocation type (r\_type)
3.  Possibly the addend too, though in Mach-O these are typically implicit

So a more complete comparison would be:

```python
def is_matching_relocation(reloc1, reloc2):
    return (
        reloc1.r_type == reloc2.r_type and
        reloc1.symbol == reloc2.symbol  # Compare symbol indices/names
    )
```

This way you catch cases where the code structure is different even if the instruction encoding looks similar (like calling different functions).

## Prompt:
basically I'm trying to compute the difference between two object files and then only compile the _changed_ symbols, leaving the unchanged symbols to be dynamic lookups against the original. hot-reloading basically.

any things I should watch out for? \* statics / globals \* dependency graph

## Response:
This is a really interesting hot-reloading approach! Here are the key things to watch out for:

1.  Statics and Globals:

*   Static variables keep state between function calls
*   If a static's initialization changes, you need to handle reinitializing it
*   Global variables might need special handling if their layout/size changes
*   Be careful of any global constructors (.ctors section)

2.  Dependency Graph:

*   If function A calls function B and B changes, you might need to recompile A too
*   Symbol versioning/binding might affect which version gets called
*   Watch out for function pointer comparisons that might break
*   Inline functions might need special attention since they're duplicated

3.  Data Sections:

*   .data and .rodata sections might need relocation
*   Need to handle any data references between functions
*   Constant pools and jump tables need careful handling

4.  Platform Specifics:

*   Different platforms handle symbol resolution differently
*   Watch out for position-dependent vs position-independent code
*   Some architectures might have special relocation types to handle

5.  Thread Safety:

*   Need to ensure atomic updates of function pointers
*   Consider what happens if a function is executing while being replaced
*   Might need synchronization mechanisms

6.  Debug Info:

*   Debug information might become invalid
*   Stack traces could get confusing

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? Also curious how you're handling the symbol replacement mechanism itself.

## Prompt:
I'm worried most about these: \* Symbol versioning/binding might affect which version gets called \* Watch out for function pointer comparisons that might break \* Be careful of any global constructors (.ctors section)

## Response:
Let's dig into each of these concerns:

1.  Symbol Versioning/Binding:

*   When you have a symbol as dynamic\_lookup, you need to be careful about symbol precedence
*   Weak vs strong symbols can affect which version gets called
*   If the original binary exports a symbol and your hot-reload module defines the same symbol, need to ensure proper override
*   The -undefined dynamic\_lookup might interact with different binding types differently

2.  Function Pointer Comparisons:

```c
// This pattern could break:
void* original_fn_ptr = &some_function;
// ... after hot reload ...
if (some_callback == original_fn_ptr) // might fail
```

*   Function pointers saved before the hot reload won't match the new addresses
*   Any code that does function pointer equality checks needs special handling
*   Callback systems that store function pointers need careful consideration

3.  Global Constructors (.ctors):

*   These run at load time by default
*   If you change a global constructor, you need to explicitly run it for the new version
*   Order matters - constructors might have dependencies
*   Need to consider what happens to already-constructed objects

```c
class Foo {
    static Foo instance; // When does this get reconstructed?
    Foo() { /* initializer that might change */ }
};
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific mitigation strategies for these issues?

## Prompt:
I think I can just force a full reload if a static _changes_ but it should still be safe to initialize it if it's new, right?

## Response:
Yes, that's a sensible approach. If you detect that a static's initialization/value hasn't changed from the original object file (using your relocation-aware comparison), it's safe to let it be initialized in the new module since it will end up in the same state anyway.

But if you detect the static's initialization has changed, forcing a full reload is safer because:

1.  The static might have already been initialized by the original module
2.  Its current state might be relied upon by other code
3.  You can't easily "re-run" just that static's initialization in isolation

So your approach makes sense:

```c
// Safe - new static
static int new_counter = 0;  // Can let this initialize

// Unsafe - changed static, force full reload
static int changed_counter = 1;  // Was '= 0' in original
```

One edge case to watch for though: if a new static's initialization depends on other statics (especially from the original module), you'll want to be extra careful about initialization order.

## Prompt:
how is a static represented in the assembly?

## Response:
In assembly, a static variable typically shows up in two places:

1.  In the data/bss sections:

```nasm
.data
_static_var:  # Or sometimes in .bss if uninitialized
    .long 42  # Initial value if initialized
```

2.  When accessed in code, it's usually through a non-external symbol reference:

```nasm
mov eax, [_static_var]  # Load from static
```

The key difference from globals is that statics are typically:

*   Not marked as external symbols
*   Have "private" or "internal" binding
*   Live in their own section with unique names to prevent collisions

So when comparing object files, you'd see:

1.  The symbol in the symbol table with internal/private binding
2.  Any relocations referencing this symbol within the code
3.  The actual data in a data/bss section

You can usually identify statics by looking for non-external symbols that have data storage and are referenced within the code.

## Prompt:
okay, now binding. every patch is compiled as `patch-{idx}.dylib` and then searched for symbols using dylsm.

is there a chance patches will collide or is that unlikely?

## Response:
Since each patch is a separate dylib, symbol collisions are less likely but still possible in a few scenarios:

1.  Multiple patches defining the same symbol:

```c
// patch-1.dylib
void foo() { /* v1 */ }

// patch-2.dylib
void foo() { /* v2 */ }
```

The dynamic linker's search order will determine which one gets used - typically the latest one loaded, but this depends on your dlsym usage.

2.  Interleaved Dependencies: If patch-1 depends on original symbol A And patch-2 provides a new version of A Which version patch-1 gets could depend on load order

The search precedence typically goes:

1.  RTLD\_SELF (current module)
2.  RTLD\_DEFAULT (global symbol scope)
3.  RTLD\_NEXT (next loaded module)

You might want to explicitly control the search order by:

*   Using RTLD\_NOLOAD to check if symbols already exist
*   Keeping track of which patch "owns" which symbols
*   Possibly using versioned symbol names like `symbol_v1`, `symbol_v2`

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these scenarios or mitigation strategies?

## Prompt:
an alternate approach would be to inject the code directly into the running process.

I found an article that uses a tool called lief to perform code injection.

this seems appealing but I think that means I'd need to patch relocations to point to addresses in the running process

## Response:
Yes, with code injection you'd need to handle the relocations yourself since you're manually placing code into the process memory. This is more complex than dylib loading because:

1.  You'd need to:

*   Allocate executable memory in the target process
*   Copy the code there
*   Fix up all the relocations manually
*   Update any references to the new code

2.  For each relocation you'd need to:

*   Find the actual runtime address of the target symbol in the process
*   Calculate the correct offset/address
*   Patch the instruction/data at the relocation site

3.  Challenges:

*   Need to handle different relocation types correctly (PC-relative vs absolute)
*   Have to find symbol addresses in the running process
*   Might need to handle position-independent code differently
*   Memory protection changes required (making memory executable)

The dylib approach delegates all this complexity to the dynamic linker, which is why it's generally safer and simpler. I'd recommend sticking with dylibs unless you have a specific reason that code injection would be better.

What's making you consider the code injection approach? Maybe there's a way to solve that problem while still using dylibs?

## Prompt:
good question - just exploring. worried that it might not be portable across windows/mac/linux

## Response:
Yes, portability would be a significant concern with code injection. Each platform has very different approaches to process memory manipulation and code injection:

Mac:

*   Strict code signing requirements
*   System Integrity Protection (SIP) restrictions
*   Specific Mach-O binary format and relocation handling

Windows:

*   Different PE/COFF binary format
*   Different APIs for process manipulation (CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx)
*   Different relocation format (base relocations)

Linux:

*   ELF format with its own relocation types
*   ptrace for process manipulation
*   Different security modules (SELinux, AppArmor) to consider

The dylib/shared library approach is actually more portable since all major platforms have standardized dynamic linking:

*   Mac: dylib
*   Windows: DLL
*   Linux: .so

You'd still need platform-specific code, but you'd be working with well-documented, supported APIs rather than potentially fragile process manipulation techniques. Plus the dynamic linker handles all the complex relocation logic for you across platforms.

## Prompt:
I have a prototype of this working for mach-o. It works really well actually.

I _think_ the main issues now are the function pointer comparison logic.

It seems to me that functions that didn't change shouldn't be present in the new dylib, forcing their resolution from the original module. Does that seem right?

## Response:
Yes, that's a really smart approach! By only including changed functions in the new dylib, any function pointer comparisons to unchanged functions will naturally resolve to the original addresses, preserving pointer equality.

So if you have:

```c
// Original module
void unchanged() { ... }
void changed() { /* old version */ }
callback_ptr = &unchanged;

// New dylib only includes
void changed() { /* new version */ }
// unchanged() is not present, forcing resolution to original
```

Then:

*   `callback_ptr == &unchanged` remains true because it resolves to same original address
*   Only `changed()` gets the new implementation
*   Any function pointer comparisons to `unchanged` stay valid

This strategy effectively makes the function pointer comparison issue mostly solve itself. You only need to worry about pointer comparisons for functions that actually changed, which probably need special handling anyway since their behavior is different.

Have you run into any edge cases with this approach so far?

## Prompt:
I just need a good way of detecting changes to statics I think.

I also think that if a struct's size and/or layout changes then I need the target program to throw out all old versions of that struct and rebuild it with the new layout which requires runtime integration.

I'm planning on basically \* reading the input object files \* removing unchanged symbols from the export map \* running dead-strip to remove un-referenced code (therefore removing unnecessary ctors?)

I _think_ this should work, but I'm worried it requires me to build a callgraph which I'm unsure how to do.

## Response:
This is a good plan! Let me break down each part:

For statics detection:

*   You can spot statics in the object file by looking for private/internal symbols with data storage
*   Compare their initial values and sizes between versions
*   You could even hash the static's data section to quickly detect changes

For struct changes:

```c
// If this changes
struct Foo {
    int x;    // Was int x, y;
    float z;  // Different offset now!
};
```

Yes, you'd need runtime integration to handle this safely. The program needs to know when to rebuild/migrate data.

For the dead code stripping:

1.  You might not need a full callgraph. Instead:
    *   Start with changed symbols
    *   Look at relocations that point TO these symbols
    *   Any symbol that has relocations pointing to changed code might need to be included
    *   Repeat until no new symbols are added

The dead-stripping should handle ctors correctly since any unused ones won't be referenced. Just make sure to keep ctors for any new/changed statics.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these parts? I'm particularly curious about your runtime integration plans for struct changes.

## Prompt:
would it be worth deleting sections from the data or just be okay with leaking contents?

## Response:
Since this is for hot-reloading during development, leaking some data sections is probably fine - it's a development tool after all. The complexity of safely removing data sections might not be worth it unless you're running into memory issues.

Reasons to leave them:

1.  Safer - no risk of accidentally removing data that might be referenced
2.  Simpler - don't need to track all data references
3.  Temporary - memory gets reclaimed when development session ends

If you did want to remove them:

*   Would need to track all references to data sections
*   Ensure no statics/globals point to that memory
*   Handle any relocations that might reference that data
*   Deal with alignment requirements for remaining sections

Given the complexity vs benefit tradeoff, I'd lean towards leaving them unless you have a specific reason to clean them up. Are you seeing any issues with leaving the data sections in place?

## Prompt:
does -dead-strip remove data automatically?

## Response:
Yes, -dead-strip will remove unreferenced data sections automatically. If a data section (like .data or .rodata) isn't referenced by any kept symbols (either directly or through relocations), the linker will remove it during dead stripping.

However, there are some important cases to watch for:

1.  Data that's referenced via assembly or in ways the linker can't detect
2.  Data that needs to be kept for runtime type information or reflection
3.  Sections that are marked as required/preserved specifically

You can verify which sections are being stripped by using:

```bash
otool -l your_binary  # To see what sections remain
```

Or comparing the size of sections before and after dead-strip:

```bash
nm -S your_binary  # Shows symbol sizes
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific types of data sections you're concerned about?

## Prompt:
okay, last few more questions...

thanks to the symbol table I know the _address_ of the symbol but not where it ends (mach-o returns a size of 0).

do you think that will cause any issues with the diffing or am I missing something?

## Response:
This is an interesting issue with Mach-O symbol tables! The size of 0 could cause problems for accurate diffing since you need to know how much code to compare.

To get the actual size, you have a few options:

1.  Look at the section data:

*   Find where the next symbol starts in the same section
*   The difference between symbol addresses gives you the size
*   Need to handle the last symbol in a section carefully

2.  Parse the actual instructions:

*   Look for function boundaries (like ret instructions)
*   More complex but might be necessary
*   Need to handle different instruction sets

3.  Use debug information if available:

*   Debug symbols often contain size information
*   Not always available though

Example approach:

```python
def get_symbol_size(symbol, symtab):
    # Find all symbols in same section
    section_symbols = [s for s in symtab if s.section == symbol.section]
    # Sort by address
    section_symbols.sort(key=lambda s: s.addr)

    # Find our symbol's position
    idx = section_symbols.index(symbol)
    if idx + 1 < len(section_symbols):
        # Size is distance to next symbol
        return section_symbols[idx + 1].addr - symbol.addr
    else:
        # Last symbol - need section end
        return section.size + section.addr - symbol.addr
```

Do you need to handle any special cases for your diffing approach?

## Prompt:
what is a ret and a jmp in assembly?

## Response:
Let me explain both instructions:

`ret` (return):

*   Pops the return address from the stack and jumps to it
*   Used at the end of functions to return to the caller
*   In x86\_64 assembly it's encoded as `C3`
*   There's also `ret n` which pops n additional bytes from the stack

`jmp` (jump):

*   Unconditionally transfers control to another location
*   Can be:
    *   Direct: `jmp target_label` (jumps to known address)
    *   Indirect: `jmp [rax]` (jumps to address stored in register)
    *   Relative: `jmp +20` (jumps relative to current instruction)
*   Common forms on x86\_64:
    *   Short jump: `EB xx` (1-byte offset)
    *   Near jump: `E9 xx xx xx xx` (4-byte offset)
    *   Indirect: `FF xx` (through register/memory)

The main difference is that `ret` uses the stack to determine where to jump (popping the return address pushed by `call`), while `jmp` gets its destination from the instruction itself or a register.

## Prompt:
I have an `__eh_frame` section with lots of relocations - it targets stuff like GCC\_except\_table. what does this do?

## Response:
The `__eh_frame` section contains Exception Handling Frame information - it's used for stack unwinding and exception handling. On x86\_64, it's crucial for:

1.  Exception handling:

*   Contains information about how to unwind the stack when an exception occurs
*   Maps program counter values to frame unwinding instructions
*   References exception tables (`GCC_except_table`) that contain:
    *   Try/catch block ranges
    *   Landing pad locations
    *   Exception type information

2.  Stack traces:

*   Used by debuggers to walk up the stack
*   Helps generate accurate backtraces when debugging

Example of what it's used for:

```cpp
try {
    throw SomeException();
} catch (SomeException& e) {
    // The eh_frame and except_table help find this handler
}
```

The relocations you're seeing are because:

*   The frame data needs to reference actual code addresses
*   It needs to find exception tables
*   It needs to locate personality routines (functions that handle the unwinding)

For your hot-reloading case:

*   You probably want to preserve this section
*   Its relocations need to be handled correctly
*   Messing it up could break exception handling in the patched code

## Prompt:
I see a few more r\_types now: \* 4, 7

ideas?

## Response:
In Mach-O format:

r\_type = 4 is X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT:

*   Used for Global Offset Table entries
*   PC-relative reference to an entry in the GOT
*   Often used for accessing global variables or external symbols in position-independent code

r\_type = 7 is X86\_64\_RELOC\_SUBTRACTOR:

*   Used for calculating a difference between two symbols
*   Often used in pairs with another relocation
*   Common in position-independent code when you need to compute the distance between two addresses

The SUBTRACTOR type is interesting because it usually works with two symbols:

1.  The first relocation (r\_type=7) references the symbol to subtract FROM
2.  The next relocation specifies the symbol to subtract

This is commonly used for:

*   Computing offsets between different parts of the code/data
*   Handling position-independent references within the same section
*   Distance calculations needed for exception handling data

Would you like to see examples of assembly patterns that generate these relocation types?

## Prompt:
my relocations seem to be falling into two buckets \* relocations targetting imported symbols \* relocations targetting local symbols (l\_\_\_unnamed\_1 **/ ltmp5)**

can you help me understand the second?

## Response:
The local symbols (starting with 'l' or 'ltmp') are compiler-generated labels for internal use. They're typically used for:

1.  Anonymous/unnamed blocks of code:

```c
// This might generate l___unnamed_1
static const char* str = "hello";
```

2.  Temporary labels the compiler needs:

```asm
ltmp5:  # Might be a loop target, exception handling label, etc
    ; some code
    jmp ltmp5  # Jump back to label
```

Common uses include:

*   Exception handling landing pads
*   Jump targets for loops/control flow
*   Local string/data constants
*   Compiler-generated helper functions
*   Switch table entries

These are internal to your object file/module and won't conflict with other modules since they're not exported. For your hot-reloading:

*   You need to handle relocations to these just like named symbols
*   These often show up in exception handling data
*   They might change between compilations even if the code is logically the same

Would you like me to show more specific examples of what generates these kinds of labels?

## Prompt:
what's the `__const` section?

## Response:
The `__const` section is where constant data is stored that's read-only - it typically contains:

1.  String literals:

```c
const char* str = "hello world";  // "hello world" goes in __const
```

2.  Constant arrays/data:

```c
static const int array[] = {1, 2, 3};  // Goes in __const
const double PI = 3.14159;  // Could go in __const
```

3.  Compiler-generated constant data:

*   Virtual table information
*   Type information
*   Switch table jump targets
*   String pools

Key characteristics:

*   Read-only (marked as non-writable in memory)
*   Can be shared between processes
*   Often merged with similar data to save space
*   Usually needs relocations if it contains addresses

The main difference from `.rodata` in ELF is mostly just naming - it serves the same purpose of storing read-only constant data.

## Prompt:
with dlopen/dlsym how would I go about walking the new _exported_ symbols? I see all the symbols.

or should I not export any symbols at all so they don't collide with other new patches and simply send along the list of changed functions/pointers to the runtime?

## Response:
For hot-reloading, NOT exporting any symbols except those that actually changed is probably the cleaner approach! This ensures:

1.  No collision between patches:

```c
// patch1.dylib - only exports what changed
void changed_fn() { /* v2 */ }  // exported
void unchanged_fn() { ... }     // not exported

// patch2.dylib - different function changed
void other_fn() { /* v2 */ }    // exported
```

2.  Forces unchanged functions to resolve to original module
3.  Makes symbol management simpler since you only track what changed

Instead of walking all symbols with dlsym, you could:

1.  Build list of changed symbols during your diff
2.  Pass this list to runtime along with the dylib
3.  Runtime only needs to dlsym the specific changed symbols

This approach is cleaner and has fewer edge cases to handle. Would you like me to elaborate on how to control symbol exports during linking to achieve this?

## Prompt:
can you summarize all the r\_types we mentioned here?

## Response:
Here's a summary of all the Mach-O relocation types (r\_type) we discussed:

0: X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED

*   Direct, absolute 64-bit address reference
*   Used for absolute addressing like pointers to data

1: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference
*   Used for RIP-relative data access like `lea rax, [rip + _data]`

2: X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference specifically for branch instructions
*   Used for jumps and calls like `jmp target` or `call function`

4: X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT

*   PC-relative reference to entry in Global Offset Table
*   Used for accessing globals/external symbols in position-independent code

7: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SUBTRACTOR

*   Used in pairs to calculate difference between two symbols
*   Common in position-independent code and exception handling data
*   First relocation (type 7) is what to subtract FROM
*   Next relocation specifies what to subtract

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these types or show specific assembly examples that generate them?

## Prompt:
oh, redo that with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

## Response:
Here's the complete list of those Mach-O relocation types (r\_type):

0: X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED

*   Direct, absolute 64-bit address reference
*   Used for absolute addressing like pointers to data

1: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference
*   Used for RIP-relative data access like `lea rax, [rip + _data]`

2: X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference specifically for branch instructions
*   Used for jumps and calls like `jmp target` or `call function`

3: X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT\_LOAD

*   PC-relative reference to GOT entry with implied _load_ from that location
*   Often used with movq instruction accessing global data through GOT

4: X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT

*   PC-relative reference to entry in Global Offset Table
*   Used for accessing globals/external symbols in position-independent code

7: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SUBTRACTOR

*   Used in pairs to calculate difference between two symbols
*   Common in position-independent code and exception handling data
*   First relocation (type 7) is what to subtract FROM
*   Next relocation specifies what to subtract

I added X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT\_LOAD (type 3) which we hadn't discussed before - it's similar to type 4 but specifically implies a load operation from the GOT entry.

## Prompt:
ld has the -reproducible flag, what exactly does that do?

## Response:
The -reproducible flag in the linker tries to make builds deterministic by:

1.  Stripping out timestamps and other time-based metadata that would make builds differ
2.  Using stable sorting orders for symbols and sections
3.  Removing system-specific paths or information

The goal is that if you build the same source code on different machines or at different times, you'll get byte-for-byte identical output. This is useful for:

*   Reproducible builds for security verification
*   Caching builds effectively
*   Comparing binaries to verify they haven't been tampered with
*   Debug info consistency

For your hot-reloading case, this could be helpful because it means the same source code should generate the same binary layout, making your diffing more reliable. However, if you're comparing binaries compiled at different optimization levels or with different compiler flags, they'll still differ even with -reproducible.

## Prompt:
how would I go about normalizing a pc\_rel (rtype=2) relocation? I assume I need to read the data _at_ the offset pointed to by the relocation but then what?

## Response:
For a PC-relative relocation (type 2, BRANCH), you'd need to:

1.  Read the 32-bit offset at the relocation site
2.  Know that it's relative to the next instruction (PC + instruction size)
3.  "Normalize" it by converting back to which symbol it's targeting

Example:

```python
def normalize_pc_rel(section_data, reloc_offset, reloc_size=4):
    # Read the 32-bit signed offset
    offset = int.from_bytes(
        section_data[reloc_offset:reloc_offset + reloc_size],
        byteorder='little',
        signed=True
    )

    # PC-relative is from *next* instruction
    next_instruction = reloc_offset + reloc_size

    # Calculate absolute target (but we don't really need this)
    # target = next_instruction + offset

    # For comparison purposes, we mainly care that:
    # 1. The relocation is the same type (2)
    # 2. It points to the same symbol
    # The actual offset value will naturally differ
```

The key insight is that for comparing functions, you don't actually need to calculate the final target - you just need to know both relocations point to the same symbol, since the actual offset will differ based on final layout.

## Prompt:
I assume the relocations need to be the same type too?

## Response:
Yes, absolutely! The relocations need to match both in:

1.  Type (r\_type) - since different types mean different addressing modes/calculations
2.  Target symbol - to ensure they're pointing to the same thing

So a full comparison would be:

```python
def are_matching_relocations(reloc1, reloc2):
    return (
        reloc1.r_type == reloc2.r_type and
        reloc1.symbol == reloc2.symbol
    )
```

For example, if one version uses a PC-relative call (type 2) and another uses an absolute call (type 0) to the same function, they should be considered different even though they target the same symbol - the instruction encoding and behavior would be different.

Want me to elaborate on any specific relocation type comparisons you're dealing with?

## Prompt:
can multiple symbols point to the same address?

## Response:
Yes, multiple symbols can point to the same address! This is fairly common and happens in several scenarios:

1.  Weak/Strong symbols:

```c
// These could resolve to same address
void foo() { }
__attribute__((weak)) void foo_weak() __attribute__((alias("foo")));
```

2.  Symbol aliases:

```c
// Explicitly making symbols point to same place
void real_implementation() { }
void alias() __attribute__((alias("real_implementation")));
```

3.  Linker scripts/symbol versioning:

```
// Different version symbols pointing to same implementation
foo@@VERS_2.0
foo@VERS_1.0
```

4.  Function/variable aliases in assembly:

```nasm
_foo:
alias_to_foo:
    ; both symbols point to this code
```

For your hot-reloading case, you might want to track this to ensure you handle all symbols that point to changed code, even if they're aliases/weak symbols pointing to the same address.

 Prompt:
what is a relocation in a binary

## Response:
A relocation in binary code refers to the process of adjusting memory addresses or references within a program when its code or data is moved to a different memory location. Let me explain this concept step by step:

1.  During program compilation and linking:
    *   Initially, the compiler generates code with placeholder addresses for variables, functions, and other symbols
    *   These placeholders need to be updated (or "relocated") to their actual memory addresses when the program is loaded
2.  Why relocations are needed:
    *   Programs often can't know their final memory location at compile time
    *   The operating system may load the program at different addresses each time
    *   Shared libraries need to work regardless of where they're loaded in memory
3.  Example: Let's say you have an instruction to jump to a function:

    ```
    JUMP 0x1000  // Jump to address 0x1000
    ```

    If the entire program gets loaded 0x500 bytes later in memory, this needs to be relocated to:

    ```
    JUMP 0x1500  // Original address + offset
    ```

4.  Types of relocations:
    *   Absolute relocations: The entire address is updated
    *   Relative relocations: Only the offset from the current position is adjusted
    *   GOT/PLT relocations: Special relocations for dynamic linking
5.  In modern systems:
    *   Position Independent Code (PIC) is often used to minimize required relocations
    *   This allows code to run correctly regardless of its absolute memory location
    *   Still, some relocations are usually necessary, especially for global data

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects of binary relocations?

## Prompt:
can a relocation point to a symbol/section outside a given `.o` file?

## Response:
Yes, absolutely! This is actually one of the main purposes of relocations - to reference symbols and sections that are external to the current object file. These are typically called "external relocations" and they're essential for linking multiple object files together.

Here are the common cases:

1.  Referencing functions defined in other `.o` files
2.  Accessing global variables declared in other compilation units
3.  Referencing sections (like `.data`, `.text`, etc.) from other object files
4.  Pointing to symbols in shared libraries that will be resolved at runtime

For example, if you have:

```c
// file1.c
extern int global_var;  // Declared but not defined here
void foo() {
    global_var = 42;    // Will need a relocation to point to the real global_var
}

// file2.c
int global_var = 0;     // Actual definition
```

When `file1.c` is compiled into `file1.o`, the reference to `global_var` will generate a relocation entry that basically says "I need the address of symbol `global_var`, but I don't know where it is yet". The linker will later resolve this by finding `global_var`'s definition in `file2.o` and updating the relocation accordingly.

## Prompt:
what is the r\_type of a relocation?

## Response:
The r\_type (relocation type) specifies how the relocation should be performed - it defines the exact calculation/operation that should be used to modify the code/data at the relocation site.

The specific types vary by architecture. For example, on x86\_64:

*   R\_X86\_64\_64: Direct 64-bit absolute reference
*   R\_X86\_64\_PC32: 32-bit PC-relative reference
*   R\_X86\_64\_PLT32: Reference to symbol's PLT entry
*   R\_X86\_64\_GOTPCREL: Reference to symbol's GOT entry with PC-relative offset
*   R\_X86\_64\_COPY: Copy symbol at runtime
*   R\_X86\_64\_GLOB\_DAT: Create GOT entry
*   R\_X86\_64\_JUMP\_SLOT: Create PLT entry

Each type defines:

1.  The size of the field being relocated (e.g., 32 or 64 bits)
2.  How to calculate the value (e.g., absolute vs PC-relative)
3.  Any special handling needed (like GOT/PLT entries)

The linker uses this type information to know exactly how to patch the binary when resolving the relocation.

## Prompt:
what is an r\_type of 0 mean for mach-o?

## Response:
In Mach-O format, a relocation type (r\_type) of 0 typically means X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED, which indicates a direct, absolute reference that needs to be relocated. This is used for absolute addressing where the full 64-bit value needs to be rewritten.

Example use cases include:

*   Pointers to data in the \_\_data section
*   Absolute addresses that need to be filled in
*   Global variable references that require absolute addressing

This is similar to R\_X86\_64\_64 in ELF format - it's for straight absolute 64-bit pointer relocations without any fancy calculations or PC-relative adjustments.

## Prompt:
what is an r\_type of 1 mean for mach-o?

## Response:
In Mach-O format, an r\_type of 1 means X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED, which represents a 32-bit signed pc-relative reference to a symbol. This is typically used for relative addressing where the target is within ±2GB of the instruction pointer.

Key points about X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED:

*   It's used for PC-relative memory references
*   The offset is relative to the current instruction pointer (RIP)
*   The value stored is 32-bit signed
*   Common in function calls and relative jumps where the target is within reach

This is similar to R\_X86\_64\_PC32 in ELF format - it's for PC-relative addressing where you need to calculate the offset from the current instruction to the target.

## Prompt:
r\_type of 2?

## Response:
In Mach-O format, an r\_type of 2 means X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH, which is specifically for branch instructions - like conditional or unconditional jumps - that use PC-relative addressing.

The key characteristics are:

*   Used for branch instructions (jmp, jcc, etc.)
*   32-bit signed pc-relative offset
*   Similar to X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED (type 1) but specifically for branch targets
*   The linker will validate that the target is actually reachable within the branch instruction's limitations

The main difference between this and type 1 (SIGNED) is that this is specifically marked for branch instructions, which can help the linker perform specific validations and optimizations for branches.

## Prompt:
can you elaborate more on r\_type = 1? where would it be used and why

## Response:
X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED (r\_type=1) is used for PC-relative memory references, typically in data access patterns. Here are the key use cases:

1.  Accessing data in the data sections relative to the instruction pointer:

```nasm
lea rax, [rip + _some_data]  // Load effective address of data relative to RIP
mov rax, [rip + _some_global] // Load value from memory relative to RIP
```

The reason for using PC-relative addressing (RIP-relative) here is:

*   Position Independent Code (PIC) support - the code can run at any address since all references are relative
*   More efficient than absolute addressing in many cases since it only needs 32 bits for the offset
*   Common in modern x86\_64 code, especially for accessing global variables and static data

This differs from X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH (r\_type=2) which is specifically for branch instructions, and from X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED (r\_type=0) which is for absolute references.

The r\_type=1 relocation is crucial for maintaining position independence while still efficiently accessing data within ±2GB of the instruction pointer.

## Prompt:
what is the addend for a relocation? i'm parsing some relocations and only see 0 but still curious

## Response:
The addend in a relocation is an extra value that gets added to the final calculated address during relocation resolution. It's basically an additional offset that gets factored into the final address calculation.

However, there are two main ways relocations store addends:

1.  Explicit addends (like in ELF):
    *   The addend is stored directly in the relocation entry
    *   The final calculation is typically: final\_address = symbol\_value + addend
2.  Implicit addends (like in Mach-O):
    *   The addend is stored in the location being relocated
    *   The linker reads the existing content at the relocation site as the addend
    *   This is why you're seeing 0 in the relocation entries themselves

In Mach-O, when you see 0 for the addend, it doesn't necessarily mean there's no offset - the offset might be encoded in the instruction or data at the relocation site itself. The linker will read that value and use it as part of the relocation calculation.

For example, if you have:

```nasm
lea rax, [rip + offset + _some_symbol]
```

The "offset" part would be stored at the relocation site, not in the relocation entry itself.

## Prompt:
what does it mean to make a symbol undefined?

## Response:
Making a symbol undefined means marking it as a symbol that is referenced in the current object file but whose definition exists elsewhere - either in another object file, shared library, or somewhere else that will be resolved during linking.

Common cases where symbols are undefined:

1.  External function calls:

```c
// The declaration makes 'printf' an undefined symbol
extern void printf(const char* fmt, ...);
```

2.  Global variables declared but not defined:

```c
// Creates an undefined reference to 'global_var'
extern int global_var;
```

3.  Functions declared but implemented in another file:

```c
// foo.h
void foo();  // Just a declaration, foo is undefined

// foo.c
void foo() { } // Actual definition
```

When you mark a symbol as undefined, you're essentially telling the linker "I need this symbol, but you'll need to find its actual definition somewhere else during linking." The linker will then search through other object files and libraries to resolve these undefined references.

If the linker can't find a definition for an undefined symbol, you'll get the familiar "undefined reference" linker error.

## Prompt:
when I pass -undefined dynamic\_lookup, what is happening?

does the linker note the undefined symbols and then defines them by hoisting them to an import?

## Response:
Yes, when you use `-undefined dynamic_lookup`, the linker allows undefined symbols to remain unresolved during link time and defers their resolution to runtime. It essentially:

1.  Notes which symbols are undefined
2.  Instead of failing with "undefined symbol" errors, it creates special entries in the dynamic symbol table marking these symbols for dynamic lookup
3.  These symbols get added to the binary's list of imports that need to be resolved by the dynamic linker at runtime

This flag is particularly useful for:

*   Dynamic languages/runtimes where symbols might be provided at runtime
*   Plugin architectures where symbols are resolved when the plugin loads
*   Cases where you know the symbol will exist at runtime but isn't available during linking

For example, in Python extensions or other dynamic modules, you might reference symbols that will be provided by the host process when the module is loaded, but aren't available during compile/link time.

The key difference from normal linking is that instead of requiring all symbols to be resolved at link time, it allows undefined symbols to exist and sets up the infrastructure for them to be resolved later at runtime.

## Prompt:
what does it mean to "relax" a relocation?

## Response:
In binary code optimization, "relaxing" a relocation means converting a relocation that uses a larger or more complex instruction sequence into a simpler or shorter one when possible. This typically happens when the linker determines that a shorter instruction sequence can be used because the target ends up being closer than initially assumed.

Common examples:

1.  Converting a long jump to a short jump when the target is close enough
2.  Replacing an indirect jump through a PLT with a direct jump if the symbol ends up being in the same module
3.  Converting a far call (using an absolute address) to a near call (PC-relative) if within range

The key benefit is code size reduction and potentially better performance since:

*   Shorter instructions take less space
*   Direct jumps are typically faster than indirect ones
*   Fewer instructions means better cache utilization

The linker performs this optimization during the linking phase when it has enough information about final symbol locations to determine if relaxation is possible.

## Prompt:
wait is the linker actually rewriting the instructions? how? is it disassembling or simply masking/truncating the larger instruction?

## Response:
No, the linker isn't doing full disassembly! It usually relies on fixed patterns - it knows the exact byte sequences of common instruction patterns and can update them accordingly.

For example, in x86\_64:

*   A long jump might be: `E9 XX XX XX XX` (5 bytes)
*   A short jump would be: `EB XX` (2 bytes)

The linker knows these patterns and can do direct byte manipulations without needing to fully understand/disassemble the instruction stream. It's more like pattern matching and byte manipulation than true instruction rewriting.

This is also why certain instruction sequences must be used in compilers if you want the linker to be able to relax them - the linker is looking for specific byte patterns it knows how to handle. If you use a different instruction sequence that technically does the same thing but has different bytes, the linker won't recognize it as something it can relax.

Would you like to see more examples of specific byte patterns that linkers commonly know how to relax?

## Prompt:
well actually I'm trying to "diff" two object files but need to account for the relocations since two functions might be mostly the same from their assembly but functions they call end up at new addresses

how would you go about "normalizing" the assembly such that these can be compared?

## Response:
Ah interesting problem! For meaningfully comparing two object files while accounting for relocations, you'd want to "normalize" the code to account for different symbol addresses. Here's how I'd approach it:

1.  For each section with relocations:
    *   Track the location of each relocation
    *   When comparing bytes, any location that has a relocation should be treated as "equal" if they're the same relocation type
    *   Essentially mask out/ignore the actual values at relocation sites since those will naturally differ

Example pseudocode approach:

```python
def normalize_and_compare(file1, file2):
    # Get relocation sites for each file
    relocs1 = get_relocation_sites(file1)
    relocs2 = get_relocation_sites(file2)

    # Get the code sections
    code1 = get_code_section(file1)
    code2 = get_code_section(file2)

    differences = []
    for i in range(min(len(code1), len(code2))):
        # If this location has a relocation in either file
        if i in relocs1 or i in relocs2:
            # Check if both have same relocation type
            if get_reloc_type(relocs1[i]) != get_reloc_type(relocs2[i]):
                differences.append(f"Different relocation types at offset {i}")
            # Skip comparing the actual bytes
            continue

        # Compare non-relocation bytes normally
        if code1[i] != code2[i]:
            differences.append(f"Byte difference at offset {i}")
```

This way you're effectively comparing the "structure" of the code while ignoring the specific values that would change due to symbol placement.

Would this approach help with what you're trying to do? I can elaborate on handling specific types of relocations if needed.

## Prompt:
that's helpful and basically what I figured. I just have to make sure the relocations target the same symbol too right?

## Response:
Yes exactly! Just matching relocation types isn't enough - you need to check that they're targeting the same symbols too, since two instructions could both be calling functions (same r\_type) but actually calling different functions.

So in addition to matching r\_type, you'd want to compare:

1.  The symbol being referenced (the symbol index/name the relocation points to)
2.  The relocation type (r\_type)
3.  Possibly the addend too, though in Mach-O these are typically implicit

So a more complete comparison would be:

```python
def is_matching_relocation(reloc1, reloc2):
    return (
        reloc1.r_type == reloc2.r_type and
        reloc1.symbol == reloc2.symbol  # Compare symbol indices/names
    )
```

This way you catch cases where the code structure is different even if the instruction encoding looks similar (like calling different functions).

## Prompt:
basically I'm trying to compute the difference between two object files and then only compile the _changed_ symbols, leaving the unchanged symbols to be dynamic lookups against the original. hot-reloading basically.

any things I should watch out for? \* statics / globals \* dependency graph

## Response:
This is a really interesting hot-reloading approach! Here are the key things to watch out for:

1.  Statics and Globals:

*   Static variables keep state between function calls
*   If a static's initialization changes, you need to handle reinitializing it
*   Global variables might need special handling if their layout/size changes
*   Be careful of any global constructors (.ctors section)

2.  Dependency Graph:

*   If function A calls function B and B changes, you might need to recompile A too
*   Symbol versioning/binding might affect which version gets called
*   Watch out for function pointer comparisons that might break
*   Inline functions might need special attention since they're duplicated

3.  Data Sections:

*   .data and .rodata sections might need relocation
*   Need to handle any data references between functions
*   Constant pools and jump tables need careful handling

4.  Platform Specifics:

*   Different platforms handle symbol resolution differently
*   Watch out for position-dependent vs position-independent code
*   Some architectures might have special relocation types to handle

5.  Thread Safety:

*   Need to ensure atomic updates of function pointers
*   Consider what happens if a function is executing while being replaced
*   Might need synchronization mechanisms

6.  Debug Info:

*   Debug information might become invalid
*   Stack traces could get confusing

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? Also curious how you're handling the symbol replacement mechanism itself.

## Prompt:
I'm worried most about these: \* Symbol versioning/binding might affect which version gets called \* Watch out for function pointer comparisons that might break \* Be careful of any global constructors (.ctors section)

## Response:
Let's dig into each of these concerns:

1.  Symbol Versioning/Binding:

*   When you have a symbol as dynamic\_lookup, you need to be careful about symbol precedence
*   Weak vs strong symbols can affect which version gets called
*   If the original binary exports a symbol and your hot-reload module defines the same symbol, need to ensure proper override
*   The -undefined dynamic\_lookup might interact with different binding types differently

2.  Function Pointer Comparisons:

```c
// This pattern could break:
void* original_fn_ptr = &some_function;
// ... after hot reload ...
if (some_callback == original_fn_ptr) // might fail
```

*   Function pointers saved before the hot reload won't match the new addresses
*   Any code that does function pointer equality checks needs special handling
*   Callback systems that store function pointers need careful consideration

3.  Global Constructors (.ctors):

*   These run at load time by default
*   If you change a global constructor, you need to explicitly run it for the new version
*   Order matters - constructors might have dependencies
*   Need to consider what happens to already-constructed objects

```c
class Foo {
    static Foo instance; // When does this get reconstructed?
    Foo() { /* initializer that might change */ }
};
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific mitigation strategies for these issues?

## Prompt:
I think I can just force a full reload if a static _changes_ but it should still be safe to initialize it if it's new, right?

## Response:
Yes, that's a sensible approach. If you detect that a static's initialization/value hasn't changed from the original object file (using your relocation-aware comparison), it's safe to let it be initialized in the new module since it will end up in the same state anyway.

But if you detect the static's initialization has changed, forcing a full reload is safer because:

1.  The static might have already been initialized by the original module
2.  Its current state might be relied upon by other code
3.  You can't easily "re-run" just that static's initialization in isolation

So your approach makes sense:

```c
// Safe - new static
static int new_counter = 0;  // Can let this initialize

// Unsafe - changed static, force full reload
static int changed_counter = 1;  // Was '= 0' in original
```

One edge case to watch for though: if a new static's initialization depends on other statics (especially from the original module), you'll want to be extra careful about initialization order.

## Prompt:
how is a static represented in the assembly?

## Response:
In assembly, a static variable typically shows up in two places:

1.  In the data/bss sections:

```nasm
.data
_static_var:  # Or sometimes in .bss if uninitialized
    .long 42  # Initial value if initialized
```

2.  When accessed in code, it's usually through a non-external symbol reference:

```nasm
mov eax, [_static_var]  # Load from static
```

The key difference from globals is that statics are typically:

*   Not marked as external symbols
*   Have "private" or "internal" binding
*   Live in their own section with unique names to prevent collisions

So when comparing object files, you'd see:

1.  The symbol in the symbol table with internal/private binding
2.  Any relocations referencing this symbol within the code
3.  The actual data in a data/bss section

You can usually identify statics by looking for non-external symbols that have data storage and are referenced within the code.

## Prompt:
okay, now binding. every patch is compiled as `patch-{idx}.dylib` and then searched for symbols using dylsm.

is there a chance patches will collide or is that unlikely?

## Response:
Since each patch is a separate dylib, symbol collisions are less likely but still possible in a few scenarios:

1.  Multiple patches defining the same symbol:

```c
// patch-1.dylib
void foo() { /* v1 */ }

// patch-2.dylib
void foo() { /* v2 */ }
```

The dynamic linker's search order will determine which one gets used - typically the latest one loaded, but this depends on your dlsym usage.

2.  Interleaved Dependencies: If patch-1 depends on original symbol A And patch-2 provides a new version of A Which version patch-1 gets could depend on load order

The search precedence typically goes:

1.  RTLD\_SELF (current module)
2.  RTLD\_DEFAULT (global symbol scope)
3.  RTLD\_NEXT (next loaded module)

You might want to explicitly control the search order by:

*   Using RTLD\_NOLOAD to check if symbols already exist
*   Keeping track of which patch "owns" which symbols
*   Possibly using versioned symbol names like `symbol_v1`, `symbol_v2`

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these scenarios or mitigation strategies?

## Prompt:
an alternate approach would be to inject the code directly into the running process.

I found an article that uses a tool called lief to perform code injection.

this seems appealing but I think that means I'd need to patch relocations to point to addresses in the running process

## Response:
Yes, with code injection you'd need to handle the relocations yourself since you're manually placing code into the process memory. This is more complex than dylib loading because:

1.  You'd need to:

*   Allocate executable memory in the target process
*   Copy the code there
*   Fix up all the relocations manually
*   Update any references to the new code

2.  For each relocation you'd need to:

*   Find the actual runtime address of the target symbol in the process
*   Calculate the correct offset/address
*   Patch the instruction/data at the relocation site

3.  Challenges:

*   Need to handle different relocation types correctly (PC-relative vs absolute)
*   Have to find symbol addresses in the running process
*   Might need to handle position-independent code differently
*   Memory protection changes required (making memory executable)

The dylib approach delegates all this complexity to the dynamic linker, which is why it's generally safer and simpler. I'd recommend sticking with dylibs unless you have a specific reason that code injection would be better.

What's making you consider the code injection approach? Maybe there's a way to solve that problem while still using dylibs?

## Prompt:
good question - just exploring. worried that it might not be portable across windows/mac/linux

## Response:
Yes, portability would be a significant concern with code injection. Each platform has very different approaches to process memory manipulation and code injection:

Mac:

*   Strict code signing requirements
*   System Integrity Protection (SIP) restrictions
*   Specific Mach-O binary format and relocation handling

Windows:

*   Different PE/COFF binary format
*   Different APIs for process manipulation (CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx)
*   Different relocation format (base relocations)

Linux:

*   ELF format with its own relocation types
*   ptrace for process manipulation
*   Different security modules (SELinux, AppArmor) to consider

The dylib/shared library approach is actually more portable since all major platforms have standardized dynamic linking:

*   Mac: dylib
*   Windows: DLL
*   Linux: .so

You'd still need platform-specific code, but you'd be working with well-documented, supported APIs rather than potentially fragile process manipulation techniques. Plus the dynamic linker handles all the complex relocation logic for you across platforms.

## Prompt:
I have a prototype of this working for mach-o. It works really well actually.

I _think_ the main issues now are the function pointer comparison logic.

It seems to me that functions that didn't change shouldn't be present in the new dylib, forcing their resolution from the original module. Does that seem right?

## Response:
Yes, that's a really smart approach! By only including changed functions in the new dylib, any function pointer comparisons to unchanged functions will naturally resolve to the original addresses, preserving pointer equality.

So if you have:

```c
// Original module
void unchanged() { ... }
void changed() { /* old version */ }
callback_ptr = &unchanged;

// New dylib only includes
void changed() { /* new version */ }
// unchanged() is not present, forcing resolution to original
```

Then:

*   `callback_ptr == &unchanged` remains true because it resolves to same original address
*   Only `changed()` gets the new implementation
*   Any function pointer comparisons to `unchanged` stay valid

This strategy effectively makes the function pointer comparison issue mostly solve itself. You only need to worry about pointer comparisons for functions that actually changed, which probably need special handling anyway since their behavior is different.

Have you run into any edge cases with this approach so far?

## Prompt:
I just need a good way of detecting changes to statics I think.

I also think that if a struct's size and/or layout changes then I need the target program to throw out all old versions of that struct and rebuild it with the new layout which requires runtime integration.

I'm planning on basically \* reading the input object files \* removing unchanged symbols from the export map \* running dead-strip to remove un-referenced code (therefore removing unnecessary ctors?)

I _think_ this should work, but I'm worried it requires me to build a callgraph which I'm unsure how to do.

## Response:
This is a good plan! Let me break down each part:

For statics detection:

*   You can spot statics in the object file by looking for private/internal symbols with data storage
*   Compare their initial values and sizes between versions
*   You could even hash the static's data section to quickly detect changes

For struct changes:

```c
// If this changes
struct Foo {
    int x;    // Was int x, y;
    float z;  // Different offset now!
};
```

Yes, you'd need runtime integration to handle this safely. The program needs to know when to rebuild/migrate data.

For the dead code stripping:

1.  You might not need a full callgraph. Instead:
    *   Start with changed symbols
    *   Look at relocations that point TO these symbols
    *   Any symbol that has relocations pointing to changed code might need to be included
    *   Repeat until no new symbols are added

The dead-stripping should handle ctors correctly since any unused ones won't be referenced. Just make sure to keep ctors for any new/changed statics.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these parts? I'm particularly curious about your runtime integration plans for struct changes.

## Prompt:
would it be worth deleting sections from the data or just be okay with leaking contents?

## Response:
Since this is for hot-reloading during development, leaking some data sections is probably fine - it's a development tool after all. The complexity of safely removing data sections might not be worth it unless you're running into memory issues.

Reasons to leave them:

1.  Safer - no risk of accidentally removing data that might be referenced
2.  Simpler - don't need to track all data references
3.  Temporary - memory gets reclaimed when development session ends

If you did want to remove them:

*   Would need to track all references to data sections
*   Ensure no statics/globals point to that memory
*   Handle any relocations that might reference that data
*   Deal with alignment requirements for remaining sections

Given the complexity vs benefit tradeoff, I'd lean towards leaving them unless you have a specific reason to clean them up. Are you seeing any issues with leaving the data sections in place?

## Prompt:
does -dead-strip remove data automatically?

## Response:
Yes, -dead-strip will remove unreferenced data sections automatically. If a data section (like .data or .rodata) isn't referenced by any kept symbols (either directly or through relocations), the linker will remove it during dead stripping.

However, there are some important cases to watch for:

1.  Data that's referenced via assembly or in ways the linker can't detect
2.  Data that needs to be kept for runtime type information or reflection
3.  Sections that are marked as required/preserved specifically

You can verify which sections are being stripped by using:

```bash
otool -l your_binary  # To see what sections remain
```

Or comparing the size of sections before and after dead-strip:

```bash
nm -S your_binary  # Shows symbol sizes
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific types of data sections you're concerned about?

## Prompt:
okay, last few more questions...

thanks to the symbol table I know the _address_ of the symbol but not where it ends (mach-o returns a size of 0).

do you think that will cause any issues with the diffing or am I missing something?

## Response:
This is an interesting issue with Mach-O symbol tables! The size of 0 could cause problems for accurate diffing since you need to know how much code to compare.

To get the actual size, you have a few options:

1.  Look at the section data:

*   Find where the next symbol starts in the same section
*   The difference between symbol addresses gives you the size
*   Need to handle the last symbol in a section carefully

2.  Parse the actual instructions:

*   Look for function boundaries (like ret instructions)
*   More complex but might be necessary
*   Need to handle different instruction sets

3.  Use debug information if available:

*   Debug symbols often contain size information
*   Not always available though

Example approach:

```python
def get_symbol_size(symbol, symtab):
    # Find all symbols in same section
    section_symbols = [s for s in symtab if s.section == symbol.section]
    # Sort by address
    section_symbols.sort(key=lambda s: s.addr)

    # Find our symbol's position
    idx = section_symbols.index(symbol)
    if idx + 1 < len(section_symbols):
        # Size is distance to next symbol
        return section_symbols[idx + 1].addr - symbol.addr
    else:
        # Last symbol - need section end
        return section.size + section.addr - symbol.addr
```

Do you need to handle any special cases for your diffing approach?

## Prompt:
what is a ret and a jmp in assembly?

## Response:
Let me explain both instructions:

`ret` (return):

*   Pops the return address from the stack and jumps to it
*   Used at the end of functions to return to the caller
*   In x86\_64 assembly it's encoded as `C3`
*   There's also `ret n` which pops n additional bytes from the stack

`jmp` (jump):

*   Unconditionally transfers control to another location
*   Can be:
    *   Direct: `jmp target_label` (jumps to known address)
    *   Indirect: `jmp [rax]` (jumps to address stored in register)
    *   Relative: `jmp +20` (jumps relative to current instruction)
*   Common forms on x86\_64:
    *   Short jump: `EB xx` (1-byte offset)
    *   Near jump: `E9 xx xx xx xx` (4-byte offset)
    *   Indirect: `FF xx` (through register/memory)

The main difference is that `ret` uses the stack to determine where to jump (popping the return address pushed by `call`), while `jmp` gets its destination from the instruction itself or a register.

## Prompt:
I have an `__eh_frame` section with lots of relocations - it targets stuff like GCC\_except\_table. what does this do?

## Response:
The `__eh_frame` section contains Exception Handling Frame information - it's used for stack unwinding and exception handling. On x86\_64, it's crucial for:

1.  Exception handling:

*   Contains information about how to unwind the stack when an exception occurs
*   Maps program counter values to frame unwinding instructions
*   References exception tables (`GCC_except_table`) that contain:
    *   Try/catch block ranges
    *   Landing pad locations
    *   Exception type information

2.  Stack traces:

*   Used by debuggers to walk up the stack
*   Helps generate accurate backtraces when debugging

Example of what it's used for:

```cpp
try {
    throw SomeException();
} catch (SomeException& e) {
    // The eh_frame and except_table help find this handler
}
```

The relocations you're seeing are because:

*   The frame data needs to reference actual code addresses
*   It needs to find exception tables
*   It needs to locate personality routines (functions that handle the unwinding)

For your hot-reloading case:

*   You probably want to preserve this section
*   Its relocations need to be handled correctly
*   Messing it up could break exception handling in the patched code

## Prompt:
I see a few more r\_types now: \* 4, 7

ideas?

## Response:
In Mach-O format:

r\_type = 4 is X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT:

*   Used for Global Offset Table entries
*   PC-relative reference to an entry in the GOT
*   Often used for accessing global variables or external symbols in position-independent code

r\_type = 7 is X86\_64\_RELOC\_SUBTRACTOR:

*   Used for calculating a difference between two symbols
*   Often used in pairs with another relocation
*   Common in position-independent code when you need to compute the distance between two addresses

The SUBTRACTOR type is interesting because it usually works with two symbols:

1.  The first relocation (r\_type=7) references the symbol to subtract FROM
2.  The next relocation specifies the symbol to subtract

This is commonly used for:

*   Computing offsets between different parts of the code/data
*   Handling position-independent references within the same section
*   Distance calculations needed for exception handling data

Would you like to see examples of assembly patterns that generate these relocation types?

## Prompt:
my relocations seem to be falling into two buckets \* relocations targetting imported symbols \* relocations targetting local symbols (l\_\_\_unnamed\_1 **/ ltmp5)**

can you help me understand the second?

## Response:
The local symbols (starting with 'l' or 'ltmp') are compiler-generated labels for internal use. They're typically used for:

1.  Anonymous/unnamed blocks of code:

```c
// This might generate l___unnamed_1
static const char* str = "hello";
```

2.  Temporary labels the compiler needs:

```asm
ltmp5:  # Might be a loop target, exception handling label, etc
    ; some code
    jmp ltmp5  # Jump back to label
```

Common uses include:

*   Exception handling landing pads
*   Jump targets for loops/control flow
*   Local string/data constants
*   Compiler-generated helper functions
*   Switch table entries

These are internal to your object file/module and won't conflict with other modules since they're not exported. For your hot-reloading:

*   You need to handle relocations to these just like named symbols
*   These often show up in exception handling data
*   They might change between compilations even if the code is logically the same

Would you like me to show more specific examples of what generates these kinds of labels?

## Prompt:
what's the `__const` section?

## Response:
The `__const` section is where constant data is stored that's read-only - it typically contains:

1.  String literals:

```c
const char* str = "hello world";  // "hello world" goes in __const
```

2.  Constant arrays/data:

```c
static const int array[] = {1, 2, 3};  // Goes in __const
const double PI = 3.14159;  // Could go in __const
```

3.  Compiler-generated constant data:

*   Virtual table information
*   Type information
*   Switch table jump targets
*   String pools

Key characteristics:

*   Read-only (marked as non-writable in memory)
*   Can be shared between processes
*   Often merged with similar data to save space
*   Usually needs relocations if it contains addresses

The main difference from `.rodata` in ELF is mostly just naming - it serves the same purpose of storing read-only constant data.

## Prompt:
with dlopen/dlsym how would I go about walking the new _exported_ symbols? I see all the symbols.

or should I not export any symbols at all so they don't collide with other new patches and simply send along the list of changed functions/pointers to the runtime?

## Response:
For hot-reloading, NOT exporting any symbols except those that actually changed is probably the cleaner approach! This ensures:

1.  No collision between patches:

```c
// patch1.dylib - only exports what changed
void changed_fn() { /* v2 */ }  // exported
void unchanged_fn() { ... }     // not exported

// patch2.dylib - different function changed
void other_fn() { /* v2 */ }    // exported
```

2.  Forces unchanged functions to resolve to original module
3.  Makes symbol management simpler since you only track what changed

Instead of walking all symbols with dlsym, you could:

1.  Build list of changed symbols during your diff
2.  Pass this list to runtime along with the dylib
3.  Runtime only needs to dlsym the specific changed symbols

This approach is cleaner and has fewer edge cases to handle. Would you like me to elaborate on how to control symbol exports during linking to achieve this?

## Prompt:
can you summarize all the r\_types we mentioned here?

## Response:
Here's a summary of all the Mach-O relocation types (r\_type) we discussed:

0: X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED

*   Direct, absolute 64-bit address reference
*   Used for absolute addressing like pointers to data

1: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference
*   Used for RIP-relative data access like `lea rax, [rip + _data]`

2: X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference specifically for branch instructions
*   Used for jumps and calls like `jmp target` or `call function`

4: X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT

*   PC-relative reference to entry in Global Offset Table
*   Used for accessing globals/external symbols in position-independent code

7: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SUBTRACTOR

*   Used in pairs to calculate difference between two symbols
*   Common in position-independent code and exception handling data
*   First relocation (type 7) is what to subtract FROM
*   Next relocation specifies what to subtract

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these types or show specific assembly examples that generate them?

## Prompt:
oh, redo that with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

## Response:
Here's the complete list of those Mach-O relocation types (r\_type):

0: X86\_64\_RELOC\_UNSIGNED

*   Direct, absolute 64-bit address reference
*   Used for absolute addressing like pointers to data

1: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SIGNED

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference
*   Used for RIP-relative data access like `lea rax, [rip + _data]`

2: X86\_64\_RELOC\_BRANCH

*   32-bit signed PC-relative reference specifically for branch instructions
*   Used for jumps and calls like `jmp target` or `call function`

3: X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT\_LOAD

*   PC-relative reference to GOT entry with implied _load_ from that location
*   Often used with movq instruction accessing global data through GOT

4: X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT

*   PC-relative reference to entry in Global Offset Table
*   Used for accessing globals/external symbols in position-independent code

7: X86\_64\_RELOC\_SUBTRACTOR

*   Used in pairs to calculate difference between two symbols
*   Common in position-independent code and exception handling data
*   First relocation (type 7) is what to subtract FROM
*   Next relocation specifies what to subtract

I added X86\_64\_RELOC\_GOT\_LOAD (type 3) which we hadn't discussed before - it's similar to type 4 but specifically implies a load operation from the GOT entry.

## Prompt:
ld has the -reproducible flag, what exactly does that do?

## Response:
The -reproducible flag in the linker tries to make builds deterministic by:

1.  Stripping out timestamps and other time-based metadata that would make builds differ
2.  Using stable sorting orders for symbols and sections
3.  Removing system-specific paths or information

The goal is that if you build the same source code on different machines or at different times, you'll get byte-for-byte identical output. This is useful for:

*   Reproducible builds for security verification
*   Caching builds effectively
*   Comparing binaries to verify they haven't been tampered with
*   Debug info consistency

For your hot-reloading case, this could be helpful because it means the same source code should generate the same binary layout, making your diffing more reliable. However, if you're comparing binaries compiled at different optimization levels or with different compiler flags, they'll still differ even with -reproducible.

## Prompt:
how would I go about normalizing a pc\_rel (rtype=2) relocation? I assume I need to read the data _at_ the offset pointed to by the relocation but then what?

## Response:
For a PC-relative relocation (type 2, BRANCH), you'd need to:

1.  Read the 32-bit offset at the relocation site
2.  Know that it's relative to the next instruction (PC + instruction size)
3.  "Normalize" it by converting back to which symbol it's targeting

Example:

```python
def normalize_pc_rel(section_data, reloc_offset, reloc_size=4):
    # Read the 32-bit signed offset
    offset = int.from_bytes(
        section_data[reloc_offset:reloc_offset + reloc_size],
        byteorder='little',
        signed=True
    )

    # PC-relative is from *next* instruction
    next_instruction = reloc_offset + reloc_size

    # Calculate absolute target (but we don't really need this)
    # target = next_instruction + offset

    # For comparison purposes, we mainly care that:
    # 1. The relocation is the same type (2)
    # 2. It points to the same symbol
    # The actual offset value will naturally differ
```

The key insight is that for comparing functions, you don't actually need to calculate the final target - you just need to know both relocations point to the same symbol, since the actual offset will differ based on final layout.

## Prompt:
I assume the relocations need to be the same type too?

## Response:
Yes, absolutely! The relocations need to match both in:

1.  Type (r\_type) - since different types mean different addressing modes/calculations
2.  Target symbol - to ensure they're pointing to the same thing

So a full comparison would be:

```python
def are_matching_relocations(reloc1, reloc2):
    return (
        reloc1.r_type == reloc2.r_type and
        reloc1.symbol == reloc2.symbol
    )
```

For example, if one version uses a PC-relative call (type 2) and another uses an absolute call (type 0) to the same function, they should be considered different even though they target the same symbol - the instruction encoding and behavior would be different.

Want me to elaborate on any specific relocation type comparisons you're dealing with?

## Prompt:
can multiple symbols point to the same address?

## Response:
Yes, multiple symbols can point to the same address! This is fairly common and happens in several scenarios:

1.  Weak/Strong symbols:

```c
// These could resolve to same address
void foo() { }
__attribute__((weak)) void foo_weak() __attribute__((alias("foo")));
```

2.  Symbol aliases:

```c
// Explicitly making symbols point to same place
void real_implementation() { }
void alias() __attribute__((alias("real_implementation")));
```

3.  Linker scripts/symbol versioning:

```
// Different version symbols pointing to same implementation
foo@@VERS_2.0
foo@VERS_1.0
```

4.  Function/variable aliases in assembly:

```nasm
_foo:
alias_to_foo:
    ; both symbols point to this code
```

For your hot-reloading case, you might want to track this to ensure you handle all symbols that point to changed code, even if they're aliases/weak symbols pointing to the same address.

: "what is a relocation in a binary"

A relocation in binary code refers to the process of adjusting memory addresses or references within a program when its code or data is moved to a different memory location. Let me explain this concept step by step:

During program compilation and linking:

Initially, the compiler generates code with placeholder addresses for variables, functions, and other symbols
These placeholders need to be updated (or "relocated") to their actual memory addresses when the program is loaded

Why relocations are needed:

Programs often can't know their final memory location at compile time
The operating system may load the program at different addresses each time
Shared libraries need to work regardless of where they're loaded in memory
Example: Let's say you have an instruction to jump to a function:
```
JUMP 0x1000  // Jump to address 0x1000
```
If the entire program gets loaded 0x500 bytes later in memory, this needs to be relocated to:

```
JUMP 0x1500  // Original address + offset
```
Types of relocations:
- Absolute relocations: The entire address is updated
- Relative relocations: Only the offset from the current position is adjusted
- GOT/PLT relocations: Special relocations for dynamic linking

In modern systems:

Position Independent Code (PIC) is often used to minimize required relocations
This allows code to run correctly regardless of its absolute memory location
Still, some relocations are usually necessary, especially for global data
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects of binary relocations?



-----
JK
can a relocation point to a symbol/section outside a given .o file?
-----
Yes, absolutely! This is actually one of the main purposes of relocations - to reference symbols and sections that are external to the current object file. These are typically called "external relocations" and they're essential for linking multiple object files together.
Here are the common cases:
Referencing functions defined in other .o files
Accessing global variables declared in other compilation units
Referencing sections (like .data, .text, etc.) from other object files
Pointing to symbols in shared libraries that will be resolved at runtime
For example, if you have:
c

Code:
// file1.c
extern int global_var;  // Declared but not defined here
void foo() {
    global_var = 42;    // Will need a relocation to point to the real global_var
}

// file2.c
int global_var = 0;     // Actual definition
When file1.c is compiled into file1.o, the reference to global_var will generate a relocation entry that basically says "I need the address of symbol global_var, but I don't know where it is yet". The linker will later resolve this by finding global_var's definition in file2.o and updating the relocation accordingly.



-----
JK
what is the r_type of a relocation?
-----
The r_type (relocation type) specifies how the relocation should be performed - it defines the exact calculation/operation that should be used to modify the code/data at the relocation site.
The specific types vary by architecture. For example, on x86_64:
R_X86_64_64: Direct 64-bit absolute reference
R_X86_64_PC32: 32-bit PC-relative reference
R_X86_64_PLT32: Reference to symbol's PLT entry
R_X86_64_GOTPCREL: Reference to symbol's GOT entry with PC-relative offset
R_X86_64_COPY: Copy symbol at runtime
R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT: Create GOT entry
R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT: Create PLT entry
Each type defines:
The size of the field being relocated (e.g., 32 or 64 bits)
How to calculate the value (e.g., absolute vs PC-relative)
Any special handling needed (like GOT/PLT entries)
The linker uses this type information to know exactly how to patch the binary when resolving the relocation.



-----
JK
what is an r_type of 0 mean for mach-o?
-----
In Mach-O format, a relocation type (r_type) of 0 typically means X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED, which indicates a direct, absolute reference that needs to be relocated. This is used for absolute addressing where the full 64-bit value needs to be rewritten.
Example use cases include:
Pointers to data in the __data section
Absolute addresses that need to be filled in
Global variable references that require absolute addressing
This is similar to R_X86_64_64 in ELF format - it's for straight absolute 64-bit pointer relocations without any fancy calculations or PC-relative adjustments.



-----
JK
what is an r_type of 1 mean for mach-o?
-----
In Mach-O format, an r_type of 1 means X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED, which represents a 32-bit signed pc-relative reference to a symbol. This is typically used for relative addressing where the target is within ±2GB of the instruction pointer.
Key points about X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED:
It's used for PC-relative memory references
The offset is relative to the current instruction pointer (RIP)
The value stored is 32-bit signed
Common in function calls and relative jumps where the target is within reach
This is similar to R_X86_64_PC32 in ELF format - it's for PC-relative addressing where you need to calculate the offset from the current instruction to the target.



-----
JK
r_type of 2?
-----
In Mach-O format, an r_type of 2 means X86_64_RELOC_BRANCH, which is specifically for branch instructions - like conditional or unconditional jumps - that use PC-relative addressing.
The key characteristics are:
Used for branch instructions (jmp, jcc, etc.)
32-bit signed pc-relative offset
Similar to X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED (type 1) but specifically for branch targets
The linker will validate that the target is actually reachable within the branch instruction's limitations
The main difference between this and type 1 (SIGNED) is that this is specifically marked for branch instructions, which can help the linker perform specific validations and optimizations for branches.



-----
JK
can you elaborate more on r_type = 1? where would it be used and why
-----
X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED (r_type=1) is used for PC-relative memory references, typically in data access patterns. Here are the key use cases:
Accessing data in the data sections relative to the instruction pointer:
nasm

Code:
lea rax, [rip + _some_data]  // Load effective address of data relative to RIP
mov rax, [rip + _some_global] // Load value from memory relative to RIP
The reason for using PC-relative addressing (RIP-relative) here is:
Position Independent Code (PIC) support - the code can run at any address since all references are relative
More efficient than absolute addressing in many cases since it only needs 32 bits for the offset
Common in modern x86_64 code, especially for accessing global variables and static data
This differs from X86_64_RELOC_BRANCH (r_type=2) which is specifically for branch instructions, and from X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED (r_type=0) which is for absolute references.
The r_type=1 relocation is crucial for maintaining position independence while still efficiently accessing data within ±2GB of the instruction pointer.



-----
JK
what is the addend for a relocation? i'm parsing some relocations and only see 0 but still curious
-----
The addend in a relocation is an extra value that gets added to the final calculated address during relocation resolution. It's basically an additional offset that gets factored into the final address calculation.
However, there are two main ways relocations store addends:
Explicit addends (like in ELF):
The addend is stored directly in the relocation entry
The final calculation is typically: final_address = symbol_value + addend
Implicit addends (like in Mach-O):
The addend is stored in the location being relocated
The linker reads the existing content at the relocation site as the addend
This is why you're seeing 0 in the relocation entries themselves
In Mach-O, when you see 0 for the addend, it doesn't necessarily mean there's no offset - the offset might be encoded in the instruction or data at the relocation site itself. The linker will read that value and use it as part of the relocation calculation.
For example, if you have:
nasm

Code:
lea rax, [rip + offset + _some_symbol]
The "offset" part would be stored at the relocation site, not in the relocation entry itself.



-----
JK
what does it mean to make a symbol undefined?
-----
Making a symbol undefined means marking it as a symbol that is referenced in the current object file but whose definition exists elsewhere - either in another object file, shared library, or somewhere else that will be resolved during linking.
Common cases where symbols are undefined:
External function calls:
c

Code:
// The declaration makes 'printf' an undefined symbol
extern void printf(const char* fmt, ...);
Global variables declared but not defined:
c

Code:
// Creates an undefined reference to 'global_var'
extern int global_var;
Functions declared but implemented in another file:
c

Code:
// foo.h
void foo();  // Just a declaration, foo is undefined

// foo.c
void foo() { } // Actual definition
When you mark a symbol as undefined, you're essentially telling the linker "I need this symbol, but you'll need to find its actual definition somewhere else during linking." The linker will then search through other object files and libraries to resolve these undefined references.
If the linker can't find a definition for an undefined symbol, you'll get the familiar "undefined reference" linker error.



-----
JK
when I pass -undefined dynamic_lookup, what is happening?
does the linker note the undefined symbols and then defines them by hoisting them to an import?
-----
Yes, when you use -undefined dynamic_lookup, the linker allows undefined symbols to remain unresolved during link time and defers their resolution to runtime. It essentially:
Notes which symbols are undefined
Instead of failing with "undefined symbol" errors, it creates special entries in the dynamic symbol table marking these symbols for dynamic lookup
These symbols get added to the binary's list of imports that need to be resolved by the dynamic linker at runtime
This flag is particularly useful for:
Dynamic languages/runtimes where symbols might be provided at runtime
Plugin architectures where symbols are resolved when the plugin loads
Cases where you know the symbol will exist at runtime but isn't available during linking
For example, in Python extensions or other dynamic modules, you might reference symbols that will be provided by the host process when the module is loaded, but aren't available during compile/link time.
The key difference from normal linking is that instead of requiring all symbols to be resolved at link time, it allows undefined symbols to exist and sets up the infrastructure for them to be resolved later at runtime.



-----
JK
what does it mean to "relax" a relocation?
-----
In binary code optimization, "relaxing" a relocation means converting a relocation that uses a larger or more complex instruction sequence into a simpler or shorter one when possible. This typically happens when the linker determines that a shorter instruction sequence can be used because the target ends up being closer than initially assumed.
Common examples:
Converting a long jump to a short jump when the target is close enough
Replacing an indirect jump through a PLT with a direct jump if the symbol ends up being in the same module
Converting a far call (using an absolute address) to a near call (PC-relative) if within range
The key benefit is code size reduction and potentially better performance since:
Shorter instructions take less space
Direct jumps are typically faster than indirect ones
Fewer instructions means better cache utilization
The linker performs this optimization during the linking phase when it has enough information about final symbol locations to determine if relaxation is possible.



-----
JK
wait is the linker actually rewriting the instructions? how? is it disassembling or simply masking/truncating the larger instruction?
-----
No, the linker isn't doing full disassembly! It usually relies on fixed patterns - it knows the exact byte sequences of common instruction patterns and can update them accordingly.
For example, in x86_64:
A long jump might be: E9 XX XX XX XX (5 bytes)
A short jump would be: EB XX (2 bytes)
The linker knows these patterns and can do direct byte manipulations without needing to fully understand/disassemble the instruction stream. It's more like pattern matching and byte manipulation than true instruction rewriting.
This is also why certain instruction sequences must be used in compilers if you want the linker to be able to relax them - the linker is looking for specific byte patterns it knows how to handle. If you use a different instruction sequence that technically does the same thing but has different bytes, the linker won't recognize it as something it can relax.
Would you like to see more examples of specific byte patterns that linkers commonly know how to relax?



-----
JK
well actually I'm trying to "diff" two object files but need to account for the relocations since two functions might be mostly the same from their assembly but functions they call end up at new addresses
how would you go  about "normalizing" the assembly such that these can be compared?
-----
Ah interesting problem! For meaningfully comparing two object files while accounting for relocations, you'd want to "normalize" the code to account for different symbol addresses. Here's how I'd approach it:
For each section with relocations:
Track the location of each relocation
When comparing bytes, any location that has a relocation should be treated as "equal" if they're the same relocation type
Essentially mask out/ignore the actual values at relocation sites since those will naturally differ
Example pseudocode approach:
python

Code:
def normalize_and_compare(file1, file2):
    # Get relocation sites for each file
    relocs1 = get_relocation_sites(file1)
    relocs2 = get_relocation_sites(file2)

    # Get the code sections
    code1 = get_code_section(file1)
    code2 = get_code_section(file2)

    differences = []
    for i in range(min(len(code1), len(code2))):
        # If this location has a relocation in either file
        if i in relocs1 or i in relocs2:
            # Check if both have same relocation type
            if get_reloc_type(relocs1[i]) != get_reloc_type(relocs2[i]):
                differences.append(f"Different relocation types at offset {i}")
            # Skip comparing the actual bytes
            continue

        # Compare non-relocation bytes normally
        if code1[i] != code2[i]:
            differences.append(f"Byte difference at offset {i}")
This way you're effectively comparing the "structure" of the code while ignoring the specific values that would change due to symbol placement.
Would this approach help with what you're trying to do? I can elaborate on handling specific types of relocations if needed.



-----
JK
that's helpful and basically what I figured. I just have to make sure the relocations target the same symbol too right?
-----
Yes exactly! Just matching relocation types isn't enough - you need to check that they're targeting the same symbols too, since two instructions could both be calling functions (same r_type) but actually calling different functions.
So in addition to matching r_type, you'd want to compare:
The symbol being referenced (the symbol index/name the relocation points to)
The relocation type (r_type)
Possibly the addend too, though in Mach-O these are typically implicit
So a more complete comparison would be:
python

Code:
def is_matching_relocation(reloc1, reloc2):
    return (
        reloc1.r_type == reloc2.r_type and
        reloc1.symbol == reloc2.symbol  # Compare symbol indices/names
    )
This way you catch cases where the code structure is different even if the instruction encoding looks similar (like calling different functions).



-----
JK
basically I'm trying to compute the difference between two object files and then only compile the changed symbols, leaving the unchanged symbols to be dynamic lookups against the original. hot-reloading basically.
any things I should watch out for?
* statics / globals
* dependency graph
-----
This is a really interesting hot-reloading approach! Here are the key things to watch out for:
Statics and Globals:
Static variables keep state between function calls
If a static's initialization changes, you need to handle reinitializing it
Global variables might need special handling if their layout/size changes
Be careful of any global constructors (.ctors section)
Dependency Graph:
If function A calls function B and B changes, you might need to recompile A too
Symbol versioning/binding might affect which version gets called
Watch out for function pointer comparisons that might break
Inline functions might need special attention since they're duplicated
Data Sections:
.data and .rodata sections might need relocation
Need to handle any data references between functions
Constant pools and jump tables need careful handling
Platform Specifics:
Different platforms handle symbol resolution differently
Watch out for position-dependent vs position-independent code
Some architectures might have special relocation types to handle
Thread Safety:
Need to ensure atomic updates of function pointers
Consider what happens if a function is executing while being replaced
Might need synchronization mechanisms
Debug Info:
Debug information might become invalid
Stack traces could get confusing
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? Also curious how you're handling the symbol replacement mechanism itself.



-----
JK
I'm worried most about these:
* Symbol versioning/binding might affect which version gets called
* Watch out for function pointer comparisons that might break
* Be careful of any global constructors (.ctors section)
-----
Let's dig into each of these concerns:
Symbol Versioning/Binding:
When you have a symbol as dynamic_lookup, you need to be careful about symbol precedence
Weak vs strong symbols can affect which version gets called
If the original binary exports a symbol and your hot-reload module defines the same symbol, need to ensure proper override
The -undefined dynamic_lookup might interact with different binding types differently
Function Pointer Comparisons:
c

Code:
// This pattern could break:
void* original_fn_ptr = &some_function;
// ... after hot reload ...
if (some_callback == original_fn_ptr) // might fail
Function pointers saved before the hot reload won't match the new addresses
Any code that does function pointer equality checks needs special handling
Callback systems that store function pointers need careful consideration
Global Constructors (.ctors):
These run at load time by default
If you change a global constructor, you need to explicitly run it for the new version
Order matters - constructors might have dependencies
Need to consider what happens to already-constructed objects
c

Code:
class Foo {
    static Foo instance; // When does this get reconstructed?
    Foo() { /* initializer that might change */ }
};
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific mitigation strategies for these issues?



-----
JK
I think I can just force a full reload if a static changes but it should still be safe to initialize it if it's new, right?
-----
Yes, that's a sensible approach. If you detect that a static's initialization/value hasn't changed from the original object file (using your relocation-aware comparison), it's safe to let it be initialized in the new module since it will end up in the same state anyway.
But if you detect the static's initialization has changed, forcing a full reload is safer because:
The static might have already been initialized by the original module
Its current state might be relied upon by other code
You can't easily "re-run" just that static's initialization in isolation
So your approach makes sense:
c

Code:
// Safe - new static
static int new_counter = 0;  // Can let this initialize

// Unsafe - changed static, force full reload
static int changed_counter = 1;  // Was '= 0' in original
One edge case to watch for though: if a new static's initialization depends on other statics (especially from the original module), you'll want to be extra careful about initialization order.



-----
JK
how is a static represented in the assembly?
-----
In assembly, a static variable typically shows up in two places:
In the data/bss sections:
nasm

Code:
.data
_static_var:  # Or sometimes in .bss if uninitialized
    .long 42  # Initial value if initialized
When accessed in code, it's usually through a non-external symbol reference:
nasm

Code:
mov eax, [_static_var]  # Load from static
The key difference from globals is that statics are typically:
Not marked as external symbols
Have "private" or "internal" binding
Live in their own section with unique names to prevent collisions
So when comparing object files, you'd see:
The symbol in the symbol table with internal/private binding
Any relocations referencing this symbol within the code
The actual data in a data/bss section
You can usually identify statics by looking for non-external symbols that have data storage and are referenced within the code.



-----
JK
okay, now binding. every patch is compiled as patch-{idx}.dylib and then searched for symbols using dylsm.
is there a chance patches will collide or is that unlikely?
-----
Since each patch is a separate dylib, symbol collisions are less likely but still possible in a few scenarios:
Multiple patches defining the same symbol:
c

Code:
// patch-1.dylib
void foo() { /* v1 */ }

// patch-2.dylib
void foo() { /* v2 */ }
The dynamic linker's search order will determine which one gets used - typically the latest one loaded, but this depends on your dlsym usage.
Interleaved Dependencies: If patch-1 depends on original symbol A And patch-2 provides a new version of A Which version patch-1 gets could depend on load order
The search precedence typically goes:
RTLD_SELF (current module)
RTLD_DEFAULT (global symbol scope)
RTLD_NEXT (next loaded module)
You might want to explicitly control the search order by:
Using RTLD_NOLOAD to check if symbols already exist
Keeping track of which patch "owns" which symbols
Possibly using versioned symbol names like symbol_v1, symbol_v2
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these scenarios or mitigation strategies?



-----
JK
an alternate approach would be to inject the code directly into the running process.
I found an article that uses a tool called lief to perform code injection.
this seems appealing but I think that means I'd need to patch relocations to point to addresses in the running process
-----
Yes, with code injection you'd need to handle the relocations yourself since you're manually placing code into the process memory. This is more complex than dylib loading because:
You'd need to:
Allocate executable memory in the target process
Copy the code there
Fix up all the relocations manually
Update any references to the new code
For each relocation you'd need to:
Find the actual runtime address of the target symbol in the process
Calculate the correct offset/address
Patch the instruction/data at the relocation site
Challenges:
Need to handle different relocation types correctly (PC-relative vs absolute)
Have to find symbol addresses in the running process
Might need to handle position-independent code differently
Memory protection changes required (making memory executable)
The dylib approach delegates all this complexity to the dynamic linker, which is why it's generally safer and simpler. I'd recommend sticking with dylibs unless you have a specific reason that code injection would be better.
What's making you consider the code injection approach? Maybe there's a way to solve that problem while still using dylibs?



-----
JK
good question - just exploring. worried that it might not be portable across windows/mac/linux
-----
Yes, portability would be a significant concern with code injection. Each platform has very different approaches to process memory manipulation and code injection:
Mac:
Strict code signing requirements
System Integrity Protection (SIP) restrictions
Specific Mach-O binary format and relocation handling
Windows:
Different PE/COFF binary format
Different APIs for process manipulation (CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx)
Different relocation format (base relocations)
Linux:
ELF format with its own relocation types
ptrace for process manipulation
Different security modules (SELinux, AppArmor) to consider
The dylib/shared library approach is actually more portable since all major platforms have standardized dynamic linking:
Mac: dylib
Windows: DLL
Linux: .so
You'd still need platform-specific code, but you'd be working with well-documented, supported APIs rather than potentially fragile process manipulation techniques. Plus the dynamic linker handles all the complex relocation logic for you across platforms.



-----
JK
I have a prototype of this working for mach-o. It works really well actually.
I think the main issues now are the function pointer comparison logic.
It seems to me that functions that didn't change shouldn't be present in the new dylib, forcing their resolution from the original module. Does that seem right?
-----
Yes, that's a really smart approach! By only including changed functions in the new dylib, any function pointer comparisons to unchanged functions will naturally resolve to the original addresses, preserving pointer equality.
So if you have:
c

Code:
// Original module
void unchanged() { ... }
void changed() { /* old version */ }
callback_ptr = &unchanged;

// New dylib only includes
void changed() { /* new version */ }
// unchanged() is not present, forcing resolution to original
Then:
callback_ptr == &unchanged remains true because it resolves to same original address
Only changed() gets the new implementation
Any function pointer comparisons to unchanged stay valid
This strategy effectively makes the function pointer comparison issue mostly solve itself. You only need to worry about pointer comparisons for functions that actually changed, which probably need special handling anyway since their behavior is different.
Have you run into any edge cases with this approach so far?



-----
JK
I just need a good way of detecting changes to statics I think.
I also think that if a struct's size and/or layout changes then I need the target program to throw out all old versions of that struct and rebuild it with the new layout which requires runtime integration.
I'm planning on basically
* reading the input object files
* removing unchanged symbols from the export map
* running dead-strip to remove un-referenced code (therefore removing unnecessary ctors?)
I think this should work, but I'm worried it requires me to build a callgraph which I'm unsure how to do.
-----
This is a good plan! Let me break down each part:
For statics detection:
You can spot statics in the object file by looking for private/internal symbols with data storage
Compare their initial values and sizes between versions
You could even hash the static's data section to quickly detect changes
For struct changes:
c

Code:
// If this changes
struct Foo {
    int x;    // Was int x, y;
    float z;  // Different offset now!
};
Yes, you'd need runtime integration to handle this safely. The program needs to know when to rebuild/migrate data.
For the dead code stripping:
You might not need a full callgraph. Instead:
Start with changed symbols
Look at relocations that point TO these symbols
Any symbol that has relocations pointing to changed code might need to be included
Repeat until no new symbols are added
The dead-stripping should handle ctors correctly since any unused ones won't be referenced. Just make sure to keep ctors for any new/changed statics.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these parts? I'm particularly curious about your runtime integration plans for struct changes.



-----
JK
would it be worth deleting sections from the data or just be okay with leaking contents?
-----
Since this is for hot-reloading during development, leaking some data sections is probably fine - it's a development tool after all. The complexity of safely removing data sections might not be worth it unless you're running into memory issues.
Reasons to leave them:
Safer - no risk of accidentally removing data that might be referenced
Simpler - don't need to track all data references
Temporary - memory gets reclaimed when development session ends
If you did want to remove them:
Would need to track all references to data sections
Ensure no statics/globals point to that memory
Handle any relocations that might reference that data
Deal with alignment requirements for remaining sections
Given the complexity vs benefit tradeoff, I'd lean towards leaving them unless you have a specific reason to clean them up. Are you seeing any issues with leaving the data sections in place?



-----
JK
does -dead-strip remove data automatically?
-----
Yes, -dead-strip will remove unreferenced data sections automatically. If a data section (like .data or .rodata) isn't referenced by any kept symbols (either directly or through relocations), the linker will remove it during dead stripping.
However, there are some important cases to watch for:
Data that's referenced via assembly or in ways the linker can't detect
Data that needs to be kept for runtime type information or reflection
Sections that are marked as required/preserved specifically
You can verify which sections are being stripped by using:
bash

Code:
otool -l your_binary  # To see what sections remain
Or comparing the size of sections before and after dead-strip:
bash

Code:
nm -S your_binary  # Shows symbol sizes
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific types of data sections you're concerned about?

okay, last few more questions...
thanks to the symbol table I know the address of the symbol but not where it ends (mach-o returns a size of 0).
do you think that will cause any issues with the diffing or am I missing something?
-----
This is an interesting issue with Mach-O symbol tables! The size of 0 could cause problems for accurate diffing since you need to know how much code to compare.
To get the actual size, you have a few options:
Look at the section data:
Find where the next symbol starts in the same section
The difference between symbol addresses gives you the size
Need to handle the last symbol in a section carefully
Parse the actual instructions:
Look for function boundaries (like ret instructions)
More complex but might be necessary
Need to handle different instruction sets
Use debug information if available:
Debug symbols often contain size information
Not always available though
Example approach:
python

Code:
def get_symbol_size(symbol, symtab):
    # Find all symbols in same section
    section_symbols = [s for s in symtab if s.section == symbol.section]
    # Sort by address
    section_symbols.sort(key=lambda s: s.addr)

    # Find our symbol's position
    idx = section_symbols.index(symbol)
    if idx + 1 < len(section_symbols):
        # Size is distance to next symbol
        return section_symbols[idx + 1].addr - symbol.addr
    else:
        # Last symbol - need section end
        return section.size + section.addr - symbol.addr
Do you need to handle any special cases for your diffing approach?

what is a ret and a jmp in assembly?
-----
Let me explain both instructions:
ret (return):
Pops the return address from the stack and jumps to it
Used at the end of functions to return to the caller
In x86_64 assembly it's encoded as C3
There's also ret n which pops n additional bytes from the stack
jmp (jump):
Unconditionally transfers control to another location
Can be:
Direct: jmp target_label (jumps to known address)
Indirect: jmp [rax] (jumps to address stored in register)
Relative: jmp +20 (jumps relative to current instruction)
Common forms on x86_64:
Short jump: EB xx (1-byte offset)
Near jump: E9 xx xx xx xx (4-byte offset)
Indirect: FF xx (through register/memory)
The main difference is that ret uses the stack to determine where to jump (popping the return address pushed by call), while jmp gets its destination from the instruction itself or a register.

I have an __eh_frame section with lots of relocations - it targets stuff like GCC_except_table. what does this do?
-----
The __eh_frame section contains Exception Handling Frame information - it's used for stack unwinding and exception handling. On x86_64, it's crucial for:
Exception handling:
Contains information about how to unwind the stack when an exception occurs
Maps program counter values to frame unwinding instructions
References exception tables (GCC_except_table) that contain:
Try/catch block ranges
Landing pad locations
Exception type information
Stack traces:
Used by debuggers to walk up the stack
Helps generate accurate backtraces when debugging
Example of what it's used for:
cpp

Code:
try {
    throw SomeException();
} catch (SomeException& e) {
    // The eh_frame and except_table help find this handler
}
The relocations you're seeing are because:
The frame data needs to reference actual code addresses
It needs to find exception tables
It needs to locate personality routines (functions that handle the unwinding)
For your hot-reloading case:
You probably want to preserve this section
Its relocations need to be handled correctly
Messing it up could break exception handling in the patched code

I see a few more r_types now:
* 4, 7
ideas?
-----
In Mach-O format:
r_type = 4 is X86_64_RELOC_GOT:
Used for Global Offset Table entries
PC-relative reference to an entry in the GOT
Often used for accessing global variables or external symbols in position-independent code
r_type = 7 is X86_64_RELOC_SUBTRACTOR:
Used for calculating a difference between two symbols
Often used in pairs with another relocation
Common in position-independent code when you need to compute the distance between two addresses
The SUBTRACTOR type is interesting because it usually works with two symbols:
The first relocation (r_type=7) references the symbol to subtract FROM
The next relocation specifies the symbol to subtract
This is commonly used for:
Computing offsets between different parts of the code/data
Handling position-independent references within the same section
Distance calculations needed for exception handling data
Would you like to see examples of assembly patterns that generate these relocation types?



-----
JK
my relocations seem to be falling into two buckets
* relocations targetting imported symbols
* relocations targetting local symbols (l___unnamed_1 / ltmp5)
can you help me understand the second?
-----
The local symbols (starting with 'l' or 'ltmp') are compiler-generated labels for internal use. They're typically used for:
Anonymous/unnamed blocks of code:
c

Code:
// This might generate l___unnamed_1
static const char* str = "hello";
Temporary labels the compiler needs:
asm

Code:
ltmp5:  # Might be a loop target, exception handling label, etc
    ; some code
    jmp ltmp5  # Jump back to label
Common uses include:
Exception handling landing pads
Jump targets for loops/control flow
Local string/data constants
Compiler-generated helper functions
Switch table entries
These are internal to your object file/module and won't conflict with other modules since they're not exported. For your hot-reloading:
You need to handle relocations to these just like named symbols
These often show up in exception handling data
They might change between compilations even if the code is logically the same
Would you like me to show more specific examples of what generates these kinds of labels?



-----
JK
what's the __const section?
-----
The __const section is where constant data is stored that's read-only - it typically contains:
String literals:
c

Code:
const char* str = "hello world";  // "hello world" goes in __const
Constant arrays/data:
c

Code:
static const int array[] = {1, 2, 3};  // Goes in __const
const double PI = 3.14159;  // Could go in __const
Compiler-generated constant data:
Virtual table information
Type information
Switch table jump targets
String pools
Key characteristics:
Read-only (marked as non-writable in memory)
Can be shared between processes
Often merged with similar data to save space
Usually needs relocations if it contains addresses
The main difference from .rodata in ELF is mostly just naming - it serves the same purpose of storing read-only constant data.

with dlopen/dlsym how would I go about walking the new exported symbols? I see all the symbols.
or should I not export any symbols at all so they don't collide with other new patches and simply send along the list of changed functions/pointers to the runtime?
-----
For hot-reloading, NOT exporting any symbols except those that actually changed is probably the cleaner approach! This ensures:
No collision between patches:
c

Code:
// patch1.dylib - only exports what changed
void changed_fn() { /* v2 */ }  // exported
void unchanged_fn() { ... }     // not exported

// patch2.dylib - different function changed
void other_fn() { /* v2 */ }    // exported
Forces unchanged functions to resolve to original module
Makes symbol management simpler since you only track what changed
Instead of walking all symbols with dlsym, you could:
Build list of changed symbols during your diff
Pass this list to runtime along with the dylib
Runtime only needs to dlsym the specific changed symbols
This approach is cleaner and has fewer edge cases to handle. Would you like me to elaborate on how to control symbol exports during linking to achieve this?

JK
can you summarize all the r_types we mentioned here?
-----
Here's a summary of all the Mach-O relocation types (r_type) we discussed:
0: X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED
Direct, absolute 64-bit address reference
Used for absolute addressing like pointers to data
1: X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED
32-bit signed PC-relative reference
Used for RIP-relative data access like lea rax, [rip + _data]
2: X86_64_RELOC_BRANCH
32-bit signed PC-relative reference specifically for branch instructions
Used for jumps and calls like jmp target or call function
4: X86_64_RELOC_GOT
PC-relative reference to entry in Global Offset Table
Used for accessing globals/external symbols in position-independent code
7: X86_64_RELOC_SUBTRACTOR
Used in pairs to calculate difference between two symbols
Common in position-independent code and exception handling data
First relocation (type 7) is what to subtract FROM
Next relocation specifies what to subtract
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these types or show specific assembly examples that generate them?



-----
JK
oh, redo that with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
-----
Here's the complete list of those Mach-O relocation types (r_type):
0: X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED
Direct, absolute 64-bit address reference
Used for absolute addressing like pointers to data
1: X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED
32-bit signed PC-relative reference
Used for RIP-relative data access like lea rax, [rip + _data]
2: X86_64_RELOC_BRANCH
32-bit signed PC-relative reference specifically for branch instructions
Used for jumps and calls like jmp target or call function
3: X86_64_RELOC_GOT_LOAD
PC-relative reference to GOT entry with implied load from that location
Often used with movq instruction accessing global data through GOT
4: X86_64_RELOC_GOT
PC-relative reference to entry in Global Offset Table
Used for accessing globals/external symbols in position-independent code
7: X86_64_RELOC_SUBTRACTOR
Used in pairs to calculate difference between two symbols
Common in position-independent code and exception handling data
First relocation (type 7) is what to subtract FROM
Next relocation specifies what to subtract
I added X86_64_RELOC_GOT_LOAD (type 3) which we hadn't discussed before - it's similar to type 4 but specifically implies a load operation from the GOT entry.

ld has the -reproducible flag, what exactly does that do?
-----
The -reproducible flag in the linker tries to make builds deterministic by:
Stripping out timestamps and other time-based metadata that would make builds differ
Using stable sorting orders for symbols and sections
Removing system-specific paths or information
The goal is that if you build the same source code on different machines or at different times, you'll get byte-for-byte identical output. This is useful for:
Reproducible builds for security verification
Caching builds effectively
Comparing binaries to verify they haven't been tampered with
Debug info consistency
For your hot-reloading case, this could be helpful because it means the same source code should generate the same binary layout, making your diffing more reliable. However, if you're comparing binaries compiled at different optimization levels or with different compiler flags, they'll still differ even with -reproducible.

how would I go about normalizing a pc_rel (rtype=2) relocation? I assume I need to read the data at the offset pointed to by the relocation but then what?
-----
For a PC-relative relocation (type 2, BRANCH), you'd need to:
Read the 32-bit offset at the relocation site
Know that it's relative to the next instruction (PC + instruction size)
"Normalize" it by converting back to which symbol it's targeting
Example:
python

Code:
def normalize_pc_rel(section_data, reloc_offset, reloc_size=4):
    # Read the 32-bit signed offset
    offset = int.from_bytes(
        section_data[reloc_offset:reloc_offset + reloc_size],
        byteorder='little',
        signed=True
    )

    # PC-relative is from *next* instruction
    next_instruction = reloc_offset + reloc_size

    # Calculate absolute target (but we don't really need this)
    # target = next_instruction + offset

    # For comparison purposes, we mainly care that:
    # 1. The relocation is the same type (2)
    # 2. It points to the same symbol
    # The actual offset value will naturally differ
The key insight is that for comparing functions, you don't actually need to calculate the final target - you just need to know both relocations point to the same symbol, since the actual offset will differ based on final layout.



-----
JK
I assume the relocations need to be the same type too?
-----
Yes, absolutely! The relocations need to match both in:
Type (r_type) - since different types mean different addressing modes/calculations
Target symbol - to ensure they're pointing to the same thing
So a full comparison would be:
python

Code:
def are_matching_relocations(reloc1, reloc2):
    return (
        reloc1.r_type == reloc2.r_type and
        reloc1.symbol == reloc2.symbol
    )
For example, if one version uses a PC-relative call (type 2) and another uses an absolute call (type 0) to the same function, they should be considered different even though they target the same symbol - the instruction encoding and behavior would be different.
Want me to elaborate on any specific relocation type comparisons you're dealing with?
