This may cause reads or writes to fail because the value is dropped while it still held.

Help:
Copy values (like CopyValue, Signal, Memo, and Resource) are owned by the scope they are created in. If you use the value in a scope that may be dropped after the origin scope,
it is very easy to use the value after it has been dropped. To fix this, you can move the value to the parent of all of the scopes that it is used in.

#[allow(unused)]
const SIGNAL_READ_WRITE_SAME_SCOPE_HELP: &str = r#"This issue is caused by reading and writing to the same signal in a reactive scope. Components, effects, memos, and resources each have their own a reactive scopes. Reactive scopes rerun when any signal you read inside of them are changed. If you read and write to the same signal in the same scope, the write will cause the scope to rerun and trigger the write again. This can cause an infinite loop.

You can fix the issue by either:
1) Splitting up your state and Writing, reading to different signals:

For example, you could change this broken code:

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct Counts {
    count1: i32,
    count2: i32,
}

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut counts = use_signal(|| Counts { count1: 0, count2: 0 });

    use_effect(move || {
        // This effect both reads and writes to counts
        counts.write().count1 = counts().count2;
    })
}

Into this working code:

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut count1 = use_signal(|| 0);
    let mut count2 = use_signal(|| 0);

    use_effect(move || {
        count1.write(count2());
    });
}
2) Reading and Writing to the same signal in different scopes:

For example, you could change this broken code:

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    use_effect(move || {
        // This effect both reads and writes to count
        println!("{}", count());
        count.write(count());
    });
}


To this working code:

fn app() -> Element {
    let mut count = use_signal(|| 0);

    use_effect(move || {
        count.write(count());
    });
    use_effect(move || {
        println!("{}", count());
    });
}
