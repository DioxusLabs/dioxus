This may cause reads or writes to fail because the value is dropped while it still held.

Help:
Copy values (like CopyValue, Signal, Memo, and Resource) are owned by the scope they are created in. If you use the value in a scope that may be dropped after the origin scope,
it is very easy to use the value after it has been dropped. To fix this, you can move the value to the parent of all of the scopes that it is used in.
