## Overview

`dioxus-autofmt` provides a pretty printer for the `rsx` syntax tree.


This is done manually with a via set of formatting rules. The output is not guaranteed to be stable between minor versions of the crate as we might tweak the output.

`dioxus-autofmt` provides an API to perform precision edits as well as just spit out a block of formatted RSX from any RSX syntax tree. This is used by the `rsx-rosetta` crate which can accept various input languages and output valid RSX.
