# This crate autofmts blocks of rsx!

This crate formats rsx! by parsing call bodies and pretty-printing them back out.

It also incorporates a fork of prettyplease to allow formatting arbitrary rust code too. Prettyplease rejected a suggestion to allow arbitrary expression formatting - something our fork lets us do.
