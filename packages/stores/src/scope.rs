//! This module contains the `SelectorScope` type with raw access to the underlying store system. Most applications should
//! use the [`Store`](dioxus_stores_macro::Store) macro to derive stores for their data structures, which provides a more ergonomic API.

/// SelectorScope is the primitive that backs the store system.
///
/// Under the hood stores consist of two different parts:
/// - The underlying lock that contains the data in the store.
/// - A tree of subscriptions used to make the store reactive.
///
/// The `SelectorScope` contains a view into the lock (`Lens`) and a path into the subscription tree. When
/// the selector is read to, it will track the current path in the subscription tree. When it it written to
/// it marks itself and all its children as dirty.
///
/// When you derive the [`Store`](dioxus_stores_macro::Store) macro on your data structure,
/// it generates methods that map the lock to a new type and scope the path to a specific part of the subscription structure.
/// For example, a `Counter` store might look like this:
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// #[derive(Store)]
/// struct Counter {
///     count: i32,
/// }
///
/// impl CounterStoreExt for Store<Counter> {
///     fn count(
///         self,
///     ) -> dioxus_stores::Store<
///         i32,
///         dioxus_stores::macro_helpers::dioxus_signals::MappedMutSignal<i32, __W>,
///     > {
///         let __map_field: fn(&CounterTree) -> &i32 = |value| &value.count;
///         let __map_mut_field: fn(&mut CounterTree) -> &mut i32 = |value| &mut value.count;
///         let scope = self.selector().scope(0u32, __map_field, __map_mut_field);
///         dioxus_stores::Store::new(scope)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The `count` method maps the lock to the `i32` type and creates a child `0` path in the subscription tree. Only writes
/// to that `0` path or its parents will trigger a re-render of the components that read the `count` field.
