#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! The asset resolver for the Dioxus bundle format. Each platform has its own way of resolving assets. This crate handles
//! resolving assets in a cross-platform way.
//!
//! There are two broad locations for assets depending on the platform:
//! - **Web**: Assets are stored on a remote server and fetched via HTTP requests.
//! - **Native**: Assets are read from the local bundle. Each platform has its own bundle structure which may store assets
//!   as a file at a specific path or in an opaque format like Android's AssetManager.
//!
//! [`read_asset_bytes`]( abstracts over both of these methods, allowing you to read the bytes of an asset
//! regardless of the platform.
//!
//! If you know you are on a desktop platform, you can use [`asset_path`] to resolve the path of an asset and read
//! the contents with [`std::fs`].
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```rust
//! # async fn asset_example() {
//! use dioxus::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Bundle the static JSON asset into the application
//! static JSON_ASSET: Asset = asset!("assets/data.json");
//!
//! // Read the bytes of the JSON asset
//! let bytes = dioxus::asset_resolver::read_asset_bytes(&JSON_ASSET).await.unwrap();
//!
//! // Deserialize the JSON data
//! let json: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_slice(&bytes).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(json["key"].as_str(), Some("value"));
//! # }
//! ```

/// This function will only work on desktop platforms. It will always return an error in web and Android
/// bundles. On Android assets are bundled in the APK, and cannot be represented as paths. In web bundles,
/// Assets are fetched via HTTP requests and don't have a filesystem path.

/// ## Example
/// ```rust
/// use dioxus::prelude::*;
///
/// // Bundle the static JSON asset into the application
/// static JSON_ASSET: Asset = asset!("assets/data.json");
///
/// // Resolve the path of the asset. This will not work in web or Android bundles
/// let path = dioxus::asset_resolver::asset_path(&JSON_ASSET).unwrap();
///
/// println!("Asset path: {:?}", path);
///
/// // Read the bytes of the JSON asset
/// let bytes = std::fs::read(path).unwrap();
///
/// // Deserialize the JSON data
/// let json: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_slice(&bytes).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(json["key"].as_str(), Some("value"));
