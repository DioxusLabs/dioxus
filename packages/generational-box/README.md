# Generational Box

Generational Box is a runtime for Rust that allows any static type to implement `Copy`. It can be combined with a global runtime to create an ergonomic state solution like `dioxus-signals`. This crate contains no `unsafe` code.

Three main types manage state in Generational Box:

- Store: Handles recycling generational boxes that have been dropped. Your application should have one store or one store per thread.
- Owner: Handles dropping generational boxes. The owner acts like a runtime lifetime guard. Any states that you create with an owner will be dropped when that owner is dropped.
- GenerationalBox: The core Copy state type. The generational box will be dropped when the owner is dropped.

Example:

```rust
// Create a store for this thread
let store = Store::default();

{
    // Create an owner for some state for a scope
    let owner = store.owner();

    // Create some non-copy data, move it into a owner, and work with copy data
    let data: String = "hello world".to_string();
    let key = owner.insert(data);
    
    // The generational box can be read from and written to like a RefCell
    let value = key.read();
    assert_eq!(*value, "hello world");
}
// Reading value at this point will cause a panic
```
