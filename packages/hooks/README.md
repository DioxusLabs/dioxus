## Overview

`dioxus-hooks` includes some basic useful hooks for dioxus:

- use_state
- use_ref
- use_future
- use_coroutine
- use_callback

Unlike React, none of these hooks are foundational since they all build off the primitive `cx.use_hook`.

This crate also provides a few helpful macros to get around some Rust lifetime management issues in async.

- `to_owned![]`
- `use_future!()`
- `use_callback!()`
