/// Maintain a handle over a future that can be paused, resumed, and canceled.
///
/// This is an upgraded form of [`use_future`] with an integrated channel system.
/// Specifically, the coroutine generated here comes with an [`UnboundedChannel`]
/// built into it - saving you the hassle of building your own.
///
/// Addititionally, coroutines are automatically injected as shared contexts, so
/// downstream components can tap into a coroutine's channel and send messages
/// into a singular async event loop.
///
/// This makes it effective for apps that need to interact with an event loop or
/// some asynchronous code without thinking too hard about state.
///
/// ## Global State
///
/// Typically, writing apps that handle concurrency properly can be difficult,
/// so the intention of this hook is to make it easy to join and poll async tasks
/// concurrently in a centralized place. You'll find that you can have much better
/// control over your app's state if you centralize your async actions, even under
/// the same concurrent context. This makes it easier to prevent undeseriable
/// states in your UI while various async tasks are already running.
///
/// This hook is especially powerful when combined with Fermi. We can store important
/// global data in a coroutine, and then access display-level values from the rest
/// of our app through atoms.
///
/// ## UseCallback instead
///
/// However, you must plan out your own concurrency and synchronization. If you
/// don't care about actions in your app being synchronized, you can use [`use_callback`]
/// hook to spawn multiple tasks and run them concurrently.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// enum Action {
///     Start,
///     Stop,
/// }
///
/// let chat_client = use_coroutine(&cx, |rx: UnboundedReceiver<Action>| async move {
///     while let Some(action) = rx.next().await {
///         match action {
///             Action::Start => {}
///             Action::Stop => {},
///         }
///     }
/// });
///
///
/// cx.render(rsx!{
///     button {
///         onclick: move |_| chat_client.send(Action::Start),
///         "Start Chat Service"
///     }
/// })
/// ```
