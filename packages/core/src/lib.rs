//!   </p>
//! </div>
//! Dioxus: a concurrent, functional, reactive virtual dom for any renderer in Rust.
//!
//! This crate aims to maintain a hook-based, renderer-agnostic framework for cross-platform UI development.
//!
//! ## Components
//! The base unit of Dioxus is the `component`. Components can be easily created from just a function - no traits required:
//! ```
//! use dioxus_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Properties)]
//! struct Props { name: String }
//!
//! fn Example(ctx: Context, props: &Props) -> VNode {
//!     html! { <div> "Hello {ctx.name}!" </div> }
//! }
//! ```
//! Components need to take a "Context" parameter which is generic over some properties. This defines how the component can be used
//! and what properties can be used to specify it in the VNode output. Component state in Dioxus is managed by hooks - if you're new
//! to hooks, check out the hook guide in the official guide.
//!
//! Components can also be crafted as static closures, enabling type inference without all the type signature noise:
//! ```
//! use dioxus_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Properties)]
//! struct Props { name: String }
//!
//! static Example: FC<Props> = |ctx| {
//!     html! { <div> "Hello {ctx.name}!" </div> }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If the properties struct is too noisy for you, we also provide a macro that converts variadic functions into components automatically.
//! Many people don't like the magic of proc macros, so this is entirely optional. Under-the-hood, we simply transplant the
//! function arguments into a struct, so there's very little actual magic happening.
//!
//! ```
//! use dioxus_core::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive_props]
//! static Example: FC = |ctx, name: &String| {
//!     html! { <div> "Hello {name}!" </div> }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hooks
//! Dioxus uses hooks for state management. Hooks are a form of state persisted between calls of the function component. Instead of
//! using a single struct to store data, hooks use the "use_hook" building block which allows the persistence of data between
//! function component renders. Each hook stores some data in a "memory cell" and needs to be called in a consistent order.
//! This means hooks "anything with `use_x`" may not be called conditionally.
//!
//! This allows functions to reuse stateful logic between components, simplify large complex components, and adopt more clear context
//! subscription patterns to make components easier to read.
//!
//! ## Supported Renderers
//! Instead of being tightly coupled to a platform, browser, or toolkit, Dioxus implements a VirtualDOM object which
//! can be consumed to draw the UI. The Dioxus VDOM is reactive and easily consumable by 3rd-party renderers via
//! the `Patch` object. See [Implementing a Renderer](docs/8-custom-renderer.md) and the `StringRenderer` classes for information
//! on how to implement your own custom renderer. We provide 1st-class support for these renderers:
//! - dioxus-desktop (via WebView)
//! - dioxus-web (via WebSys)
//! - dioxus-ssr (via StringRenderer)
//! - dioxus-liveview (SSR + StringRenderer)
//!
