/// A virtual node system that progresses user events and diffs UI trees.
///
/// ## Guide
///
/// Components are defined as simple functions that take [`Scope`] and return an [`Element`].
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// #[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
/// struct AppProps {
///     title: String
/// }
///
/// fn App(cx: Scope<AppProps>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!(
///         div {"hello, {cx.props.title}"}
///     ))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Components may be composed to make complex apps.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// fn App(cx: Scope<AppProps>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!(
///         NavBar { routes: ROUTES }
///         Title { "{cx.props.title}" }
///         Footer {}
///     ))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To start an app, create a [`VirtualDom`] and call [`VirtualDom::rebuild`] to get the list of edits required to
/// draw the UI.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(App);
/// let edits = vdom.rebuild();
/// ```
///
/// To call listeners inside the VirtualDom, call [`VirtualDom::handle_event`] with the appropriate event data.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// vdom.handle_event(event);
/// ```
///
/// While no events are ready, call [`VirtualDom::wait_for_work`] to poll any futures inside the VirtualDom.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// vdom.wait_for_work().await;
/// ```
///
/// Once work is ready, call [`VirtualDom::render_with_deadline`] to compute the differences between the previous and
/// current UI trees. This will return a [`Mutations`] object that contains Edits, Effects, and NodeRefs that need to be
/// handled by the renderer.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let mutations = vdom.work_with_deadline(tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)));
///
/// for edit in mutations.edits {
///     real_dom.apply(edit);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To not wait for suspense while diffing the VirtualDom, call [`VirtualDom::render_immediate`] or pass an immediately
/// ready future to [`VirtualDom::render_with_deadline`].
///
///
/// ## Building an event loop around Dioxus:
///
/// Putting everything together, you can build an event loop around Dioxus by using the methods outlined above.
/// ```rust, ignore
/// fn app(cx: Scope) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx! {
///         div { "Hello World" }
///     })
/// }
///
/// let dom = VirtualDom::new(app);
///
/// real_dom.apply(dom.rebuild());
///
/// loop {
///     select! {
///         _ = dom.wait_for_work() => {}
///         evt = real_dom.wait_for_event() => dom.handle_event(evt),
///     }
///
///     real_dom.apply(dom.render_immediate());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Waiting for suspense
///
/// Because Dioxus supports suspense, you can use it for server-side rendering, static site generation, and other usecases
/// where waiting on portions of the UI to finish rendering is important. To wait for suspense, use the
/// [`VirtualDom::render_with_deadline`] method:
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let dom = VirtualDom::new(app);
///
/// let deadline = tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
/// let edits = dom.render_with_deadline(deadline).await;
/// ```
///
/// ## Use with streaming
///
/// If not all rendering is done by the deadline, it might be worthwhile to stream the rest later. To do this, we
/// suggest rendering with a deadline, and then looping between [`VirtualDom::wait_for_work`] and render_immediate until
/// no suspended work is left.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let dom = VirtualDom::new(app);
///
/// let deadline = tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(20));
/// let edits = dom.render_with_deadline(deadline).await;
///
/// real_dom.apply(edits);
///
/// while dom.has_suspended_work() {
///    dom.wait_for_work().await;
///    real_dom.apply(dom.render_immediate());
/// }
/// ```

        ------------------------
        The algorithm works by walking through the list of dynamic attributes, checking their paths, and breaking when
        we find the target path.

        With the target path, we try and move up to the parent until there is no parent.
        Due to how bubbling works, we call the listeners before walking to the parent.

        If we wanted to do capturing, then we would accumulate all the listeners and call them in reverse order.
        ----------------------

        For a visual demonstration, here we present a tree on the left and whether or not a listener is collected on the
        right.
