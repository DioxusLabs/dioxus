/// A virtual node system that progresses user events and diffs UI trees.
///
///
/// ## Guide
///
/// Components are defined as simple functions that take [`Scope`] and return an [`Element`].
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// #[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
/// struct AppProps {
///     title: String
/// }
///
/// fn App(cx: Scope<AppProps>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!(
///         div {"hello, {cx.props.title}"}
///     ))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Components may be composed to make complex apps.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// fn App(cx: Scope<AppProps>) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!(
///         NavBar { routes: ROUTES }
///         Title { "{cx.props.title}" }
///         Footer {}
///     ))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To start an app, create a [`VirtualDom`] and call [`VirtualDom::rebuild`] to get the list of edits required to
/// draw the UI.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(App);
/// let edits = vdom.rebuild();
/// ```
///
/// To inject UserEvents into the VirtualDom, call [`VirtualDom::get_scheduler_channel`] to get access to the scheduler.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let channel = vdom.get_scheduler_channel();
/// channel.send_unbounded(SchedulerMsg::UserEvent(UserEvent {
///     // ...
/// }))
/// ```
///
/// While waiting for UserEvents to occur, call [`VirtualDom::wait_for_work`] to poll any futures inside the VirtualDom.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// vdom.wait_for_work().await;
/// ```
///
/// Once work is ready, call [`VirtualDom::work_with_deadline`] to compute the differences between the previous and
/// current UI trees. This will return a [`Mutations`] object that contains Edits, Effects, and NodeRefs that need to be
/// handled by the renderer.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// let mutations = vdom.work_with_deadline(|| false);
/// for edit in mutations {
///     apply(edit);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Building an event loop around Dioxus:
///
/// Putting everything together, you can build an event loop around Dioxus by using the methods outlined above.
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// fn App(cx: Scope) -> Element {
///     cx.render(rsx!{
///         div { "Hello World" }
///     })
/// }
///
/// async fn main() {
///     let mut dom = VirtualDom::new(App);
///
///     let mut inital_edits = dom.rebuild();
///     apply_edits(inital_edits);
///
///     loop {
///         dom.wait_for_work().await;
///         let frame_timeout = TimeoutFuture::new(Duration::from_millis(16));
///         let deadline = || (&mut frame_timeout).now_or_never();
///         let edits = dom.run_with_deadline(deadline).await;
///         apply_edits(edits);
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/*
Scopes and ScopeArenas are never dropped internally.
An app will always occupy as much memory as its biggest form.

This means we need to handle all specifics of drop *here*. It's easier
to reason about centralizing all the drop logic in one spot rather than scattered in each module.

Broadly speaking, we want to use the remove_nodes method to clean up *everything*
This will drop listeners, borrowed props, and hooks for all components.
We need to do this in the correct order - nodes at the very bottom must be dropped first to release
the borrow chain.

Once the contents of the tree have been cleaned up, we can finally clean up the
memory used by ScopeState itself.

questions:
should we build a vcomponent for the root?
- probably - yes?
- store the vcomponent in the root dom

- 1: Use remove_nodes to use the ensure_drop_safety pathway to safely drop the tree
- 2: Drop the ScopeState itself
