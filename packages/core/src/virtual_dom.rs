/// A virtual node system that progresses user events and diffs UI trees.
///
/// ## Guide
///
/// Components are defined as simple functions that take [`crate::properties::Properties`] and return an [`Element`].
///
/// ```rust
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Props, PartialEq, Clone)]
/// struct AppProps {
///     title: String
/// }
///
/// fn app(cx: AppProps) -> Element {
///     rsx!(
///         div {"hello, {cx.title}"}
///     )
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Components may be composed to make complex apps.
///
/// ```rust
/// # #![allow(unused)]
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
///
/// # #[derive(Props, PartialEq, Clone)]
/// # struct AppProps {
/// #     title: String
/// # }
///
/// static ROUTES: &str = "";
///
/// #[component]
/// fn app(cx: AppProps) -> Element {
///     rsx!(
///         NavBar { routes: ROUTES }
///         Title { "{cx.title}" }
///         Footer {}
///     )
/// }
///
/// #[component]
/// fn NavBar( routes: &'static str) -> Element {
///     rsx! {
///         div { "Routes: {routes}" }
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[component]
/// fn Footer() -> Element {
///     rsx! { div { "Footer" } }
/// }
///
/// #[component]
/// fn Title( children: Element) -> Element {
///     rsx! {
///         div { id: "title", {children} }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To start an app, create a [`VirtualDom`] and call [`VirtualDom::rebuild`] to get the list of edits required to
/// draw the UI.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
/// # use dioxus_core::*;
/// # fn app() -> Element { rsx! { div {} } }
///
/// let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(app);
/// let edits = vdom.rebuild_to_vec();
/// ```
///
/// To call listeners inside the VirtualDom, call [`Runtime::handle_event`] with the appropriate event data.
///
/// ```rust, no_run
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
/// # use dioxus_core::*;
/// # fn app() -> Element { rsx! { div {} } }
/// # let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(app);
/// # let runtime = vdom.runtime();
/// let event = Event::new(std::rc::Rc::new(0) as std::rc::Rc<dyn std::any::Any>, true);
/// runtime.handle_event("onclick", event, ElementId(0));
/// ```
///
/// While no events are ready, call [`VirtualDom::wait_for_work`] to poll any futures inside the VirtualDom.
///
/// ```rust, no_run
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
/// # use dioxus_core::*;
/// # fn app() -> Element { rsx! { div {} } }
/// # let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(app);
/// tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
///     vdom.wait_for_work().await;
/// });
/// ```
///
/// Once work is ready, call [`VirtualDom::render_immediate`] to compute the differences between the previous and
/// current UI trees. This will write edits to a [`WriteMutations`] object you pass in that contains with edits that need to be
/// handled by the renderer.
///
/// ```rust, no_run
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
/// # use dioxus_core::*;
/// # fn app() -> Element { rsx! { div {} } }
/// # let mut vdom = VirtualDom::new(app);
/// let mut mutations = Mutations::default();
///
/// vdom.render_immediate(&mut mutations);
/// ```
///
/// To not wait for suspense while diffing the VirtualDom, call [`VirtualDom::render_immediate`].
///
///
/// ## Building an event loop around Dioxus:
///
/// Putting everything together, you can build an event loop around Dioxus by using the methods outlined above.
/// ```rust, no_run
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
/// # use dioxus_core::*;
/// # struct RealDom;
/// # struct Event {}
/// # impl RealDom {
/// #     fn new() -> Self {
/// #         Self {}
/// #     }
/// #     fn apply(&mut self) -> Mutations {
/// #         unimplemented!()
/// #     }
/// #     async fn wait_for_event(&mut self) -> std::rc::Rc<dyn std::any::Any> {
/// #         unimplemented!()
/// #     }
/// # }
/// #
/// # tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
/// let mut real_dom = RealDom::new();
///
/// #[component]
/// fn app() -> Element {
///     rsx! {
///         div { "Hello World" }
///     }
/// }
///
/// let mut dom = VirtualDom::new(app);
///
/// dom.rebuild(&mut real_dom.apply());
///
/// loop {
///     tokio::select! {
///         _ = dom.wait_for_work() => {}
///         evt = real_dom.wait_for_event() => {
///             let evt = dioxus_core::Event::new(evt, true);
///             dom.runtime().handle_event("onclick", evt, ElementId(0))
///         },
///     }
///
///     dom.render_immediate(&mut real_dom.apply());
/// }
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// ## Waiting for suspense
///
/// Because Dioxus supports suspense, you can use it for server-side rendering, static site generation, and other use cases
/// where waiting on portions of the UI to finish rendering is important. To wait for suspense, use the
/// [`VirtualDom::wait_for_suspense`] method:
///
/// ```rust, no_run
/// # use dioxus::prelude::*;
/// # use dioxus_core::*;
/// # fn app() -> Element { rsx! { div {} } }
/// tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
///     let mut dom = VirtualDom::new(app);
///
///     dom.rebuild_in_place();
///     dom.wait_for_suspense().await;
/// });
///
/// // Render the virtual dom
/// ```
