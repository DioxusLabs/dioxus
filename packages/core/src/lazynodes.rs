//! Support for storing lazy-nodes on the stack
//!
//! This module provides support for a type called `LazyNodes` which is a micro-heap located on the stack to make calls
//! to `rsx!` more efficient.
//!
//! To support returning rsx! from branches in match statements, we need to use dynamic dispatch on [`ScopeState`] closures.
//!
//! This can be done either through boxing directly, or by using dynamic-sized-types and a custom allocator. In our case,
//! we build a tiny alloactor in the stack and allocate the closure into that.
//!
//! The logic for this was borrowed from <https://docs.rs/stack_dst/0.6.1/stack_dst/>. Unfortunately, this crate does not
//! support non-static closures, so we've implemented the core logic of `ValueA` in this module.
