/// Every "Props" used for a component must implement the `Properties` trait. This trait gives some hints to Dioxus
/// on how to memoize the props and some additional optimizations that can be made. We strongly encourage using the
/// derive macro to implement the `Properties` trait automatically as guarantee that your memoization strategy is safe.
///
/// If your props are 'static, then Dioxus will require that they also be PartialEq for the derived memoize strategy. However,
/// if your props borrow data, then the memoization strategy will simply default to "false" and the PartialEq will be ignored.
/// This tends to be useful when props borrow something that simply cannot be compared (IE a reference to a closure);
///
/// By default, the memoization strategy is very conservative, but can be tuned to be more aggressive manually. However,
/// this is only safe if the props are 'static - otherwise you might borrow references after-free.
///
/// We strongly suggest that any changes to memoization be done at the "PartialEq" level for 'static props. Additionally,
/// we advise the use of smart pointers in cases where memoization is important.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// For props that are 'static:
/// ```rust, ignore
/// #[derive(Props, PartialEq)]
/// struct MyProps {
///     data: String
/// }
/// ```
///
/// For props that borrow:
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// #[derive(Props)]
/// struct MyProps<'a >{
///     data: &'a str
/// }
/// ```
