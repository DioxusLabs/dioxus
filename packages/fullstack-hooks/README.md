# Dioxus Streaming Context

This crate provides a context for [`dioxus-fullstack`](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus-fullstack) about the context of the html stream. If streaming rendering is enabled, the context can be used to check if the first http chunk has been sent and the response metadata cannot be changed.

## Usage

```rust
todo
```
