# Current Status: Android Java Source Integration

## Summary

Implemented shipping Java sources instead of compiling them in build.rs. This avoids Java version conflicts and simplifies the build process.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Package Structure
- ✅ Created `android-shim/src/main/java/com/dioxus/geoloc/` directory
- ✅ Moved `LocationCallback.java` to proper location
- ✅ Removed old `src/android_shim/` directory

### 2. Build System Simplification
- ✅ Removed all Java compilation from `build.rs`
- ✅ Removed `android-build` dependency from `Cargo.toml`
- ✅ Simplified `android/callback.rs` to use standard JNI `find_class()`
- ✅ No more DEX embedding complexity

### 3. CLI Integration
- ✅ Added `app_java` directory creation
- ✅ Created `copy_dependency_java_sources()` function
- ✅ Scans packages for `android-shim/src/main/java/` directories
- ✅ Copies Java files preserving package structure
- ✅ Fixed WRY Kotlin directory creation timing issue

### 4. Gradle Version
- ✅ Updated to Gradle 8.10 (supports Java 23)

## Current Issue

Build is failing at WRY compilation with:
```
Failed to canonicalize `WRY_ANDROID_KOTLIN_FILES_OUT_DIR` path
```

**Fixed:** Added `create_dir_all()` before setting the environment variable to ensure the directory exists for WRY's canonicalize check.

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild should work now with the directory fix
2. Verify Java sources are copied to Android project
3. Verify Gradle compiles them successfully
4. Test that JNI calls work at runtime

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ No Java compilation in build.rs
- ✅ No version conflicts (Gradle handles it)
- ✅ Standard Android workflow
- ✅ Simpler JNI code
- ✅ Permissions automatically injected
