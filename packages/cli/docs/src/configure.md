# Configure Project

This chapter will teach you how to configure the CLI with the `Dioxus.toml` file.
There's an [example](#config-example) which has comments to describe individual keys.
You can copy that or view this documentation for a more complete learning experience.

"üîí" indicates a mandatory item. Some headers are mandatory, but none of the keys inside them are. It might look weird, but it's normal. Simply don't include any keys.

## Structure

Each header has it's TOML form directly under it.

### Application üîí

```toml
[application]
```

Application-wide configuration. Applies to both web and desktop.

1. **name** üîí - Project name & title.
   ```toml
   name = "my_project"
   ```

2. **default_platform** üîí - The platform this project targets
   ```toml
   # Currently supported platforms: web, desktop
   default_platform = "web"
   ```

3. **out_dir** - The directory to place the build artifacts from `dx build` or `dx serve` into. This is also where the `assets` directory will be copied into.
    ```toml
    out_dir = "dist"
    ```

4. **asset_dir** - The directory with your static assets. The CLI will automatically copy these assets into the **out_dir** after a build/serve.
   ```toml
   asset_dir = "public"
   ```

5. **sub_package** - The sub package in the workspace to build by default.
   ```toml
   sub_package = "my-crate"
   ```

### Web.App üîí

```toml
[web.app]
```

Web-specific configuration.

1. **title** - The title of the web page.
   ```toml
   # HTML title tag content
   title = "project_name"
   ```

2. **base_path** - The base path to build the application for serving at. This can be useful when serving your application in a subdirectory under a domain. For example when building a site to be served on GitHub Pages.
   ```toml
   # The application will be served at domain.com/my_application/, so we need to modify the base_path to the path where the application will be served
   base_path = "my_application"
   ```

### Web.Watcher ‚úç

```toml
[web.watcher]
```

Development server configuration.

1. **reload_html** - If this is true, the cli will rebuild the index.html file every time the application is rebuilt
   ```toml
   reload_html = true
   ```

2. **watch_path** - The files & directories to monitor for changes
   ```toml
   watch_path = ["src", "public"]
   ```

3. **index_on_404** - If enabled, Dioxus will serve the root page when a route is not found.
*This is needed when serving an application that uses the router*.
However, when serving your app using something else than Dioxus (e.g. GitHub Pages), you will have to check how to configure it on that platform.
In GitHub Pages, you can make a copy of `index.html` named `404.html` in the same directory. 
   ```toml
   index_on_404 = true
   ```

### Web.Resource üîí

```toml
[web.resource]
```

Static resource configuration.

1. **style** - CSS files to include in your application.
   ```toml
   style = [
      # Include from public_dir.
      "./assets/style.css",
      # Or some asset from online cdn.
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"
   ]
   ```

2. **script** - JavaScript files to include in your application.
    ```toml
    script = [
        # Include from asset_dir.
        "./public/index.js",
        # Or from an online CDN.
        "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"
    ]
   ```

### Web.Resource.Dev üîí

```toml
[web.resource.dev]
```

This is the same as [`[web.resource]`](#webresource-), but it only works in development servers.
For example, if you want to include a file in a `dx serve` server, but not a `dx serve --release` server, put it here.

### Web.Proxy

```toml
[[web.proxy]]
```

Configuration related to any proxies your application requires during development. Proxies will forward requests to a new service.

1. **backend** - The URL to the server to proxy. The CLI will forward any requests under the backend relative route to the backend instead of returning 404
   ```toml
   backend = "http://localhost:8000/api/"
   ```
   This will cause any requests made to the dev server with prefix /api/ to be redirected to the backend server at http://localhost:8000. The path and query parameters will be passed on as-is (path rewriting is currently not supported).

## Config example

This includes all fields, mandatory or not.

```toml
[application]

# App name
name = "project_name"

# The Dioxus platform to default to
default_platform = "web"

# `build` & `serve` output path
out_dir = "dist"

# The static resource path
asset_dir = "public"

[web.app]

# HTML title tag content
title = "project_name"

[web.watcher]

# When watcher is triggered, regenerate the `index.html`
reload_html = true

# Which files or dirs will be monitored
watch_path = ["src", "public"]

# Include style or script assets
[web.resource]

# CSS style file
style = []

# Javascript code file
script = []

[web.resource.dev]

# Same as [web.resource], but for development servers

# CSS style file
style = []

# JavaScript files
script = []

[[web.proxy]]
backend = "http://localhost:8000/api/"
```
