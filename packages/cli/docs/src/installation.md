# Installation

Choose any one of the methods below to install the Dioxus CLI:

## Install from latest git version

To get the most up to date bug fixes and features of the Dioxus CLI, you can install the development version from git.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/Dioxuslabs/cli
```

This will automatically download `Dioxus-CLI` source from github master branch,
and install it in Cargo's global binary directory (`~/.cargo/bin/` by default).

## Install from `crates.io` version

The published version of the Dioxus CLI is updated less often, but should be more stable than the git version of the Dioxus CLI.

```
cargo install dioxus-cli
```
