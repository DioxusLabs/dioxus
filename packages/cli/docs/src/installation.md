# Installation

There are multiple ways to install the Dioxus CLI tool. Choose any one of the methods below that best suit your needs.

## Install from latest master version

We suggest you use `github master` version to install it now.

We have not yet released the latest version to `crates.io`

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/Dioxuslabs/cli
```

This will automatically download `Dioxus-CLI` source from github master branch,
and install it in Cargo's global binary directory (`~/.cargo/bin/` by default).

## Install from `crates.io` version

```
cargo install dioxus-cli
```

Make sure to add the Cargo bin directory to your `PATH`.
