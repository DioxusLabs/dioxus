//! The core build module for `dx`, enabling building, bundling, and runtime hot-patching of Rust
//! applications. This module defines the entire end-to-end build process, including bundling for
//! all major platforms including Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly.
//!
//! The bulk of the builder code is contained within the [`request`] module which establishes the
//! arguments and flow of the build process. The [`context`] module contains the context for the build
//! including status updates and build customization. The [`patch`] module contains the logic for
//! hot-patching Rust code through binary analysis and a custom linker. The [`builder`] module contains
//! the management of the ongoing build and methods to open the build as a running app.
