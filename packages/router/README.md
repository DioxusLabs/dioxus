## Overview

Dioxus Router is a first-party Router for all your Dioxus Apps. It provides a React-Router style interface using somewhat loose typing rules.

```rust, ignore
fn app() {
    cx.render(rsx! {
        Router {
            Route { to: "/", Component {} },
            Route { to: "/blog", Blog {} },
            Route { to: "/blog/:id", BlogPost {} },
        }
    })
}
```

You need to enable the right features for the platform you're targeting since these are not determined automatically!
